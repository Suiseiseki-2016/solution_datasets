          "content": "Problem 1. Sinking Ship.The problem has lots of solutions. I will tell most simple which I saw.Let's make structure {string,integer} (pair<string,int> in C++), we read the data into array of our structure, transforming rank to a priority (number). After that the necessary number of times equal to quantity of priorities (this problem - 4), we output those names from array which have the equal to cycle count priority.Some solutions fell, who didn't consider indexes in sorting, i.e. used simply sort on a rank, instead of taking index in structure, or instead of stable_sort.Problem 2. Settlers Training.Let's make array A with size k+1 where Ai is a number of settlers with a rank i. After that, while exist a settler with rank lower k (A[k] not equally n), we model training activity. Finally we output the needed amount of coins.It is necessary not to be mistaken only, in bypassing an array with ranks from left to right, though the test 2 saves us from this potential error.Problem 3. Bulls and Cows.We make an array with 10000 elements, mark all possible in this game number by ones. Then we eliminate these numbers by game rules for every of n input, i.e. we mark with zero the numbers from an array at which comparison with ai don't give numbers of bulls and cows bi and ci.Finally if there is only one marked number - it's the answer, if there are several such numbers  - there is not enough information, if no one number is marked - the data is incorrect.Problem 4. Dividing Island.The main problem - to make areas connected.It's possible to solve this problem so: we fill our island with a snake which moves through a column upwards-downwards and moves to a next column at its filling. Initial coordinate is (1,1) if A is even or B = 1, or (B, 1) if A is odd and B > 1.",

          "content": "Problem 1. Sinking Ship.The problem has lots of solutions. I will tell most simple which I saw.Let's make structure {string,integer} (pair<string,int> in C++), we read the data into array of our structure, transforming rank to a priority (number). After that the necessary number of times equal to quantity of priorities (this problem - 4), we output those names from array which have the equal to cycle count priority.Some solutions fell, who didn't consider indexes in sorting, i.e. used simply sort on a rank, instead of taking index in structure, or instead of stable_sort.Problem 2. Settlers Training.Let's make array A with size k+1 where Ai is a number of settlers with a rank i. After that, while exist a settler with rank lower k (A[k] not equally n), we model training activity. Finally we output the needed amount of coins.It is necessary not to be mistaken only, in bypassing an array with ranks from left to right, though the test 2 saves us from this potential error.Problem 3. Bulls and Cows.We make an array with 10000 elements, mark all possible in this game number by ones. Then we eliminate these numbers by game rules for every of n input, i.e. we mark with zero the numbers from an array at which comparison with ai don't give numbers of bulls and cows bi and ci.Finally if there is only one marked number - it's the answer, if there are several such numbers  - there is not enough information, if no one number is marked - the data is incorrect.Problem 4. Dividing Island.The main problem - to make areas connected.It's possible to solve this problem so: we fill our island with a snake which moves through a column upwards-downwards and moves to a next column at its filling. Initial coordinate is (1,1) if A is even or B = 1, or (B, 1) if A is odd and B > 1.",

I will tell most simple which I saw.Let's make structure {string,integer} (pair<string,int> in C++), we read the data into array of our structure, transforming rank to a priority (number). After that the necessary number of times equal to quantity of priorities (this problem - 4), we output those names from array which have the equal to cycle count priority.Some solutions fell, who didn't consider indexes in sorting, i.e. used simply sort on a rank, instead of taking index in structure, or instead of stable_sort.Problem 2. Settlers Training.Let's make array A with size k+1 where Ai is a number of settlers with a rank i. After that, while exist a settler with rank lower k (A[k] not equally n), we model training activity. Finally we output the needed amount of coins.It is necessary not to be mistaken only, in bypassing an array with ranks from left to right, though the test 2 saves us from this potential error.Problem 3. Bulls and Cows.We make an array with 10000 elements, mark all possible in this game number by ones. Then we eliminate these numbers by game rules for every of n input, i.e. we mark with zero the numbers from an array at which comparison with ai don't give numbers of bulls and cows bi and ci.Finally if there is only one marked number - it's the answer, if there are several such numbers  - there is not enough information, if no one number is marked - the data is incorrect.Problem 4. Dividing Island.The main problem - to make areas connected.It's possible to solve this problem so: we fill our island with a snake which moves through a column upwards-downwards and moves to a next column at its filling. Initial coordinate is (1,1) if A is even or B = 1, or (B, 1) if A is odd and B > 1.",

          "content": "Problem 1. Sinking Ship.The problem has lots of solutions. I will tell most simple which I saw.Let's make structure {string,integer} (pair<string,int> in C++), we read the data into array of our structure, transforming rank to a priority (number). After that the necessary number of times equal to quantity of priorities (this problem - 4), we output those names from array which have the equal to cycle count priority.Some solutions fell, who didn't consider indexes in sorting, i.e. used simply sort on a rank, instead of taking index in structure, or instead of stable_sort.Problem 2. Settlers Training.Let's make array A with size k+1 where Ai is a number of settlers with a rank i. After that, while exist a settler with rank lower k (A[k] not equally n), we model training activity. Finally we output the needed amount of coins.It is necessary not to be mistaken only, in bypassing an array with ranks from left to right, though the test 2 saves us from this potential error.Problem 3. Bulls and Cows.We make an array with 10000 elements, mark all possible in this game number by ones. Then we eliminate these numbers by game rules for every of n input, i.e. we mark with zero the numbers from an array at which comparison with ai don't give numbers of bulls and cows bi and ci.Finally if there is only one marked number - it's the answer, if there are several such numbers  - there is not enough information, if no one number is marked - the data is incorrect.Problem 4. Dividing Island.The main problem - to make areas connected.It's possible to solve this problem so: we fill our island with a snake which moves through a column upwards-downwards and moves to a next column at its filling. Initial coordinate is (1,1) if A is even or B = 1, or (B, 1) if A is odd and B > 1.",

          "content": "Problem 1. Sinking Ship.The problem has lots of solutions. I will tell most simple which I saw.Let's make structure {string,integer} (pair<string,int> in C++), we read the data into array of our structure, transforming rank to a priority (number). After that the necessary number of times equal to quantity of priorities (this problem - 4), we output those names from array which have the equal to cycle count priority.Some solutions fell, who didn't consider indexes in sorting, i.e. used simply sort on a rank, instead of taking index in structure, or instead of stable_sort.Problem 2. Settlers Training.Let's make array A with size k+1 where Ai is a number of settlers with a rank i. After that, while exist a settler with rank lower k (A[k] not equally n), we model training activity. Finally we output the needed amount of coins.It is necessary not to be mistaken only, in bypassing an array with ranks from left to right, though the test 2 saves us from this potential error.Problem 3. Bulls and Cows.We make an array with 10000 elements, mark all possible in this game number by ones. Then we eliminate these numbers by game rules for every of n input, i.e. we mark with zero the numbers from an array at which comparison with ai don't give numbers of bulls and cows bi and ci.Finally if there is only one marked number - it's the answer, if there are several such numbers  - there is not enough information, if no one number is marked - the data is incorrect.Problem 4. Dividing Island.The main problem - to make areas connected.It's possible to solve this problem so: we fill our island with a snake which moves through a column upwards-downwards and moves to a next column at its filling. Initial coordinate is (1,1) if A is even or B = 1, or (B, 1) if A is odd and B > 1.",

          "content": "A. Again Twenty Five!The problem of getting the last two digits is equivalent to the problem of getting the number modulo 100. So we need to calculate . According to the rules of modular arithmeticSoLet's note that 52 = 25. ThenAnd so on. All are equal to 25 for all n ≥ 2.So to solve the problem one need to just output 25. There is no need to read n.B. Moore's LawEvery second the number is multiplied by 1.000000011. Multiplication several times to the same number is equivalent to exponentiation. So the formula is n·1.000000011t (1.000000011 raised to the power of t and then multiplied to n). In a program one should not use a loop to calculate power as it is too slow for such big n, usually a programming language provides a function for exponentiation such as pow.C. Lucky NumbersThere are 2 lucky numbers of the length 1. They are 7 and 8. There are 4 lucky numbers of the length 2. They are 77, 78, 87 and 88. There are 8 lucky numbers of the length 3. They are 777, 778, 787, 788, 877, 878, 887, 888. For each addition of 1 to the length the number of lucky numbers is increased times 2. It is easy to prove: to any number of the previous length one can append 7 or 8, so one number of the prevous length creates two numbers of the next length.So for the length n the amount of lucky numbers of the length exactly n is 2n. But in the problem we need the amount of lucky numbers of length not greater than n. Let's sum up them. 21 = 2, 21 + 22 = 2 + 4 = 6, 21 + 22 + 23 = 2 + 4 + 8 = 14, 21 + 22 + 23 + 24 = 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 30. One can notice that the sum of all previous powers of two is equal to the next power of two minus the first power of two. So the answer to the problem is 2n + 1 - 2.One of the possible implementations of 2n + 1 in a programming language is to shift 1 bitwise to the left for n + 1 binary digits or to shift 2 bitwise to the left for n binary digits. For example, in Java the problem answer formula is (2L << n) - 2, in C++ is (2LL << n) - 2. Suffixes L and LL correspondingly are required so that result of the shift expression have 64-bit integer type (long in Java and long long in C++). Type of the second operand does not matter for the type of shift expression, only the type of the first operand. Also parenthesis are required because without them subtraction is performed first and only then bitwise shift.D. Hexagons!Let's count the number of cells having the distance of exactly n. For n = 0 it is 1, for n = 1 it is 6, for n = 2 it is 12, for n = 3 it is 18 and so on. One can notice that n = 0 is a special case, and then the amount increases by addition of 6. These numbers form an arithmetic progression. In the problem we need to sum these numbers. The formula of the sum of an arithmetic progression is (first + last)·amount / 2. The first is 6, the last is 6n, the amount is n. So the sum is (6 + 6n)n / 2 = 3(n + 1)n. And plus 1 that is not in the arithmetic progression. So the final formula is 1 + 3n(n + 1).To avoid overflow, multiplication in the formula should be performed in 64-bit integer type. For this either 3 or 1 or n should have 64-bit integer type. The literals are 64-bit integer when they have suffix L in Java or LL in C++.E. A rectangleLet's see how the number of affected cells changes depending on the column. For example 3, 2, 3, 2, 3. That is it alternates between the size of the first column and the size of the first column minus one. The amount of \"minus ones\" is the amount of columns divided by 2 rounded down. Without \"minus ones\" all columns have equal size and the total amount of cells is equal to size of the first column multiplied by the number of the columns. The first column size is (y2 - y1) / 2 + 1. The columns amount is x2 - x1 + 1. So the final formula is ((y2 - y1) / 2 + 1)·(x2 - x1 + 1) - (x2 - x1) / 2.To avoid overflow, multiplication should be computed in 64-bit integer type.F. Selection of PersonnelThe amount of ways to choose a group of 5 people from n candidates is equal to the number of combinations , the amount of ways to choose a group of 6 people from n candidates is , the amount of ways to choose a group of 7 people from n candidates is , the amount of ways to choose a group of 5, 6 or 7 people from n candidates is .To avoid 64-bit integer overflow can be calculated in the following way: n / 1 * (n - 1) / 2 * (n - 2) / 3 * (n - 3) / 4 * (n - 4) / 5 * (n - 5) / 6 * (n - 6) / 7. Each division returns an integer because each prefix of this formula after division is also the number of combinations .G. Challenge PennantsFirst of all, ways to place both types of the pennants are independent. So each way to place \"I fixed a critical bug\" pennants on n tables is compatible to each way to place \"I suggested a new feature\" pennants on n tables. Therefore the answer of the problem is equal to the number of ways to place \"I fixed a critical bug\" pennants multiplied by the number of ways to place \"I suggested a new feature\" pennant.The number of ways to place k identical items into n different places when any place can contain any amount of items is the definition of the number of k-combinations with repetitions or k-multicombinations. The formula for the number is .So the whole formula for the problem is .To avoid overflow of 64-bit integer type recommended formulas for computation are (n + 2) / 1 * (n + 1) / 2 * n / 3 and (n + 4) / 1 * (n + 3) / 2 * (n + 2) / 3 * (n + 1) / 4 * n / 5.H. BenchesThe number of ways to choose 5 east to west paths that will have benches from n is . There are n ways to place a bench on the first of these paths. Given the place of the first bench there are n - 1 ways to place a bench on the second of these paths because one of north to south paths is already taken. Given the places of the first and second benches there are n - 2 ways to place a bench on the third of these paths because two of north to south paths are already taken. And the same way n - 3 and n - 4 for the fourth and the fifth benches. Total number of ways to place benches on selected 5 east to west path is n(n - 1)(n - 2)(n - 3)(n - 4). So the formula for the problem is .To avoid 64-bit integer overflow recommended order of computation is exactly as in the formula above, division should not be the last operation.I. Parking LotThere are the following ways to place n cars of the same make. They can be the first n, the last n, or they can be somewhere in the middle of the parking lot.When n cars of the same make are the first or the last, there are 4 ways to choose the make of these n cars, then there are 3 ways to choose the make of one car adjacent to them (the make should be different from the make of n cars) and there are 4 ways to choose the make of each of the remaining n - 3 cars. So the formula for the case of n cars of the same make on either end of the parking lot is 4·3·4n - 3.When n cars of the same make are situated somewhere in the middle, there are 4 ways to choose the make of these n cars, then there are 3 ways to choose the make of each of two cars adjacent to them (the makes of these two cars should be different from the make of n cars) and there are 4 ways to choose the make of each of the remaining n - 4 cars. So the formula for the case of n cars of the same make on a given position somewhere in the middle of the parking lot is 4·32·4n - 4.There are 2 positions of n cars of the same make in the end of the parking lot and there are n - 3 positions of n cars of the same make somewhere in the middle of the parking lot. So the final formula is 2·4·3·4n - 3 + (n - 3)·4·32·4n - 4.J. DivisibilityLet's factorize numbers from 2 to 10. 2 = 2, 3 = 3, 4 = 22, 5 = 5, 6 = 2·3, 7 = 7, 8 = 23, 9 = 32, 10 = 2·5. If a number is divisible by all numbers from 2 to 10, its factorization should contain 2 at least in the power of 3, 3 at least in the power of 2, 5 and 7 at least in the power of 1. So it can be written as x·23·32·5·7 = x·2520. So any number divisible by 2520 is divisible by all numbers from 2 to 10.There are numbers from 1 to n divisible by all numbers from 2 to 10. In a programming language it is usually implemented as simple integer division.K. IndivisibilityThe amount of numbers from 1 to n not divisible by any number from 2 to 10 is equal to the amount of all numbers from 1 to n (that is n) minus the amount of numbers from 1 to n divisible by some number from 2 to 10.The set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by some number from 2 to 10 can be found as union of the set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by 2, the set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by 3 and so on till 10.Note that sets of numbers divisible by 4 or 6 or 8 are subsets of the set of numbers divisible by 2, and sets of numbers divisible by 6 or 9 are subsets of the set of numbers divisible by 3. So there is no need to unite 9 sets, it is enough to unite sets for 2, 3, 5, 7 only.The size of set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by some of 2, 3, 5, 7 can be calculated using inclusion-exclusion principle that says that size of each single set should be added, size of pairwise intersections should be subtracted, size of all intersections of three sets should be added and so on.The size of set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by 2 is equal to , the size of set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by 2 and 3 is equal to and so on.The final formula is Division with rounding down in the formula in a programming language is usually just integer division.L. Cracking the CodeIn this problem just implementation of the actions described in the statement is required. However there are two catches in this problem.The first catch is that the fifth power of five-digit number cannot be represented by a 64-bit integer. But we need not the fifth power, we need the fifth power modulo 105. And mod operation can be applied after each multiplication (see problem A above).The second catch is that you need to output five digits, not the fifth power modulo 105. The difference is when fifth digit from the end is zero. To output a number with the leading zero one can either use corresponding formatting (%05d in printf) or extract digits and output them one by one.M. TurnFirst of all, let's reduce camera rotation angle to [0, 359] degrees range. It is accomplished by the following C++/Java code: angle = (angle % 360 + 360) % 360;Then there are the following cases: [0, 44] degrees — no need to rotate, 45 degrees — 0 or 1 turn to minimum deviation, minimum is 0, [46, 134] degrees — one turn required, 135 degrees — 1 or 2 turns to minimum deviation, minimum is 1, [136, 224] degrees — two turns required, 225 degrees — 2 or 3 turns to minimum deviation, minimum is 2, [226, 314] degrees — three turns required, 315 degrees — 3 or 0 turns to minimum deviation, minimum is 0, [316, 359] degrees — no need to rotate. Let's add 44 degrees to the angle from the range [0, 359]. C++/Java code is angle = (angle + 44) % 360; Then the ranges will be: [0, 89] degrees — 0 turns, [90, 179] degrees — 1 turn, [180, 269] degrees — 2 turns, [270, 358] degrees — 3 turns, 359 degrees — 0 turns. One special case of 359 degrees can be eliminated by taking angle modulo 359. Then just integer division by 90 is required to get the answer. C++/Java code is answer = (angle % 359) / 90;N. ForecastThere is nothing special in solving a quadratic equation but the problem has one catch. You should output the greater root first.The simplest approach is to output max(x1, x2) first, then min(x1, x2).Another approach is based upon the sign of a. for a > 0 and for a < 0.We can divide all coefficients by a, and then the first coefficient will be positive. But notice that division should be done in a floating point type and a should be divided last otherwise resulting a / a = 1 would not be able to divide b and c.O. ArrowTo get a vector of the given length b in the direction of the given vector (vx, vy) it is just required to normalize the given vector (divide it by its length) and then multiply by b.Let's denote , vnx = vx / len, vny = vy / len. Then (vnx, vny) is the normalized vector, and the first point of the arrow is (px + vnx·b, py + vny·b).To get the second point of the arrow one needs to rotate the normalized vector 90 degrees counter-clockwise and then multiply by the half of the triangle base a / 2. Let's denote vlx =  - vny, vly = vnx. Then (vlx, vly) is the normalized vector 90 degrees counter-clockwise to (vnx, vny). So the second point of the arrow is (px + vlx·a / 2, py + vly·a / 2).The third point can be found the same way as the second point but the length of the vector to it is c / 2. So the third point of the arrow is (px + vlx·c / 2, py + vly·c / 2).The fourth point can be found by adding the vector of the length c / 2 to the left of the given and the vector of the length d reverse to the given. So the fourth point of the arrow is (px + vlx·c / 2 - vnx·d, py + vly·c / 2 - vny·d).The remaining points are symmetrical to the points discussed above so they can be obtained the same way, just using minus for (vlx, vly) instead of plus. So the next points are (px - vlx·c / 2 - vnx·d, py - vly·c / 2 - vny·d), (px - vlx·c / 2, py - vly·c / 2), (px - vlx·a / 2, py - vly·a / 2).P. Area of a Star where n in the number of the star corners because in a regular star all angles between corners are equal. because of symmetry. because it is an inscribed angle. because of symmetry.So we know OA = r and and . We can calculate the area of AOB triangle knowing the length of a side and two angles adjacent to it using formula .The whole star area is equal to 2n areas of AOB triangle because of symmetry. .Q. PyramidsThe volume of a pyramid can be calculated as where v is the volume, s is the area of the base and h is the height from the base to the apex. Let's calculate s and h.The area of a regular polygon having n sides of length ln can be found the following way.On the figure above a regular polygon is shown. O is the center of the polygon, all sides are equal to ln, OB is the altitude of AOC triangle. As the polygon is a regular one OA = OC, AOC triangle is a isosceles one and then and AB = BC, also AOB and COB triangles are right-angled ones. Also because the polygon is a regular one and can be seen as a union of 2n triangles equal to AOB triangle then .AOB triangle is right-angled one, so , . Also . So and . The area of AOB is equal to . The area of the polygon is .On the figure above a triangle formed by the pyramid apex H, the center of the base O and some vertex of the base A is shown. It is a right-angled one. As all edges of the pyramid are equal, AH = ln and from calculations above . According to Pythagorean theorem OA2 + OH2 = AH2. So .The volume of one piramid is .And the final formula is .R. GameFor the field of an even size there is a winning strategy for the second player. Namely, to paint a cell that is symmetrical with respect to the center of the field to the cell painted by the first player on the previous turn. After each turn of the second player the field is centrosymmetrical and so there is always a cell that can be painted that is symmetrical with respect to the center of the field to any cell that the first player can choose to paint. .... 1... .1.. .... ....\n.... .... .... 1... .1..\n.... .... .... ...2 ..2.\n.... ...2 ..2. .... ....For the field of an odd size there is a winning strategy for the first player. Namely, on the first turn to paint the central cell, then to paint a cell that is symmetrical with respect to the center of the field to the cell painted by the second player on the previous turn. After each turn of the first player the field is centrosymmetrical and so there is always a cell that can be painted that is symmetrical with respect to the center of the field to any cell that the second player can choose to paint. ..... 2.... .2... ..2.. .....\n..... ..... ..... ..... .2...\n..1.. ..1.. ..1.. ..1.. ..1..\n..... ..... ..... ..... ...1.\n..... ....1 ...1. ..1.. .....So for even n the answer is 2, for odd n the answer is 1. One of the possible formulas for the problem is .n can be up to 1018 so at least 64-bit integer type should be used to input it.",

          "content": "A. Again Twenty Five!The problem of getting the last two digits is equivalent to the problem of getting the number modulo 100. So we need to calculate . According to the rules of modular arithmeticSoLet's note that 52 = 25. ThenAnd so on. All are equal to 25 for all n ≥ 2.So to solve the problem one need to just output 25. There is no need to read n.B. Moore's LawEvery second the number is multiplied by 1.000000011. Multiplication several times to the same number is equivalent to exponentiation. So the formula is n·1.000000011t (1.000000011 raised to the power of t and then multiplied to n). In a program one should not use a loop to calculate power as it is too slow for such big n, usually a programming language provides a function for exponentiation such as pow.C. Lucky NumbersThere are 2 lucky numbers of the length 1. They are 7 and 8. There are 4 lucky numbers of the length 2. They are 77, 78, 87 and 88. There are 8 lucky numbers of the length 3. They are 777, 778, 787, 788, 877, 878, 887, 888. For each addition of 1 to the length the number of lucky numbers is increased times 2. It is easy to prove: to any number of the previous length one can append 7 or 8, so one number of the prevous length creates two numbers of the next length.So for the length n the amount of lucky numbers of the length exactly n is 2n. But in the problem we need the amount of lucky numbers of length not greater than n. Let's sum up them. 21 = 2, 21 + 22 = 2 + 4 = 6, 21 + 22 + 23 = 2 + 4 + 8 = 14, 21 + 22 + 23 + 24 = 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 30. One can notice that the sum of all previous powers of two is equal to the next power of two minus the first power of two. So the answer to the problem is 2n + 1 - 2.One of the possible implementations of 2n + 1 in a programming language is to shift 1 bitwise to the left for n + 1 binary digits or to shift 2 bitwise to the left for n binary digits. For example, in Java the problem answer formula is (2L << n) - 2, in C++ is (2LL << n) - 2. Suffixes L and LL correspondingly are required so that result of the shift expression have 64-bit integer type (long in Java and long long in C++). Type of the second operand does not matter for the type of shift expression, only the type of the first operand. Also parenthesis are required because without them subtraction is performed first and only then bitwise shift.D. Hexagons!Let's count the number of cells having the distance of exactly n. For n = 0 it is 1, for n = 1 it is 6, for n = 2 it is 12, for n = 3 it is 18 and so on. One can notice that n = 0 is a special case, and then the amount increases by addition of 6. These numbers form an arithmetic progression. In the problem we need to sum these numbers. The formula of the sum of an arithmetic progression is (first + last)·amount / 2. The first is 6, the last is 6n, the amount is n. So the sum is (6 + 6n)n / 2 = 3(n + 1)n. And plus 1 that is not in the arithmetic progression. So the final formula is 1 + 3n(n + 1).To avoid overflow, multiplication in the formula should be performed in 64-bit integer type. For this either 3 or 1 or n should have 64-bit integer type. The literals are 64-bit integer when they have suffix L in Java or LL in C++.E. A rectangleLet's see how the number of affected cells changes depending on the column. For example 3, 2, 3, 2, 3. That is it alternates between the size of the first column and the size of the first column minus one. The amount of \"minus ones\" is the amount of columns divided by 2 rounded down. Without \"minus ones\" all columns have equal size and the total amount of cells is equal to size of the first column multiplied by the number of the columns. The first column size is (y2 - y1) / 2 + 1. The columns amount is x2 - x1 + 1. So the final formula is ((y2 - y1) / 2 + 1)·(x2 - x1 + 1) - (x2 - x1) / 2.To avoid overflow, multiplication should be computed in 64-bit integer type.F. Selection of PersonnelThe amount of ways to choose a group of 5 people from n candidates is equal to the number of combinations , the amount of ways to choose a group of 6 people from n candidates is , the amount of ways to choose a group of 7 people from n candidates is , the amount of ways to choose a group of 5, 6 or 7 people from n candidates is .To avoid 64-bit integer overflow can be calculated in the following way: n / 1 * (n - 1) / 2 * (n - 2) / 3 * (n - 3) / 4 * (n - 4) / 5 * (n - 5) / 6 * (n - 6) / 7. Each division returns an integer because each prefix of this formula after division is also the number of combinations .G. Challenge PennantsFirst of all, ways to place both types of the pennants are independent. So each way to place \"I fixed a critical bug\" pennants on n tables is compatible to each way to place \"I suggested a new feature\" pennants on n tables. Therefore the answer of the problem is equal to the number of ways to place \"I fixed a critical bug\" pennants multiplied by the number of ways to place \"I suggested a new feature\" pennant.The number of ways to place k identical items into n different places when any place can contain any amount of items is the definition of the number of k-combinations with repetitions or k-multicombinations. The formula for the number is .So the whole formula for the problem is .To avoid overflow of 64-bit integer type recommended formulas for computation are (n + 2) / 1 * (n + 1) / 2 * n / 3 and (n + 4) / 1 * (n + 3) / 2 * (n + 2) / 3 * (n + 1) / 4 * n / 5.H. BenchesThe number of ways to choose 5 east to west paths that will have benches from n is . There are n ways to place a bench on the first of these paths. Given the place of the first bench there are n - 1 ways to place a bench on the second of these paths because one of north to south paths is already taken. Given the places of the first and second benches there are n - 2 ways to place a bench on the third of these paths because two of north to south paths are already taken. And the same way n - 3 and n - 4 for the fourth and the fifth benches. Total number of ways to place benches on selected 5 east to west path is n(n - 1)(n - 2)(n - 3)(n - 4). So the formula for the problem is .To avoid 64-bit integer overflow recommended order of computation is exactly as in the formula above, division should not be the last operation.I. Parking LotThere are the following ways to place n cars of the same make. They can be the first n, the last n, or they can be somewhere in the middle of the parking lot.When n cars of the same make are the first or the last, there are 4 ways to choose the make of these n cars, then there are 3 ways to choose the make of one car adjacent to them (the make should be different from the make of n cars) and there are 4 ways to choose the make of each of the remaining n - 3 cars. So the formula for the case of n cars of the same make on either end of the parking lot is 4·3·4n - 3.When n cars of the same make are situated somewhere in the middle, there are 4 ways to choose the make of these n cars, then there are 3 ways to choose the make of each of two cars adjacent to them (the makes of these two cars should be different from the make of n cars) and there are 4 ways to choose the make of each of the remaining n - 4 cars. So the formula for the case of n cars of the same make on a given position somewhere in the middle of the parking lot is 4·32·4n - 4.There are 2 positions of n cars of the same make in the end of the parking lot and there are n - 3 positions of n cars of the same make somewhere in the middle of the parking lot. So the final formula is 2·4·3·4n - 3 + (n - 3)·4·32·4n - 4.J. DivisibilityLet's factorize numbers from 2 to 10. 2 = 2, 3 = 3, 4 = 22, 5 = 5, 6 = 2·3, 7 = 7, 8 = 23, 9 = 32, 10 = 2·5. If a number is divisible by all numbers from 2 to 10, its factorization should contain 2 at least in the power of 3, 3 at least in the power of 2, 5 and 7 at least in the power of 1. So it can be written as x·23·32·5·7 = x·2520. So any number divisible by 2520 is divisible by all numbers from 2 to 10.There are numbers from 1 to n divisible by all numbers from 2 to 10. In a programming language it is usually implemented as simple integer division.K. IndivisibilityThe amount of numbers from 1 to n not divisible by any number from 2 to 10 is equal to the amount of all numbers from 1 to n (that is n) minus the amount of numbers from 1 to n divisible by some number from 2 to 10.The set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by some number from 2 to 10 can be found as union of the set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by 2, the set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by 3 and so on till 10.Note that sets of numbers divisible by 4 or 6 or 8 are subsets of the set of numbers divisible by 2, and sets of numbers divisible by 6 or 9 are subsets of the set of numbers divisible by 3. So there is no need to unite 9 sets, it is enough to unite sets for 2, 3, 5, 7 only.The size of set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by some of 2, 3, 5, 7 can be calculated using inclusion-exclusion principle that says that size of each single set should be added, size of pairwise intersections should be subtracted, size of all intersections of three sets should be added and so on.The size of set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by 2 is equal to , the size of set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by 2 and 3 is equal to and so on.The final formula is Division with rounding down in the formula in a programming language is usually just integer division.L. Cracking the CodeIn this problem just implementation of the actions described in the statement is required. However there are two catches in this problem.The first catch is that the fifth power of five-digit number cannot be represented by a 64-bit integer. But we need not the fifth power, we need the fifth power modulo 105. And mod operation can be applied after each multiplication (see problem A above).The second catch is that you need to output five digits, not the fifth power modulo 105. The difference is when fifth digit from the end is zero. To output a number with the leading zero one can either use corresponding formatting (%05d in printf) or extract digits and output them one by one.M. TurnFirst of all, let's reduce camera rotation angle to [0, 359] degrees range. It is accomplished by the following C++/Java code: angle = (angle % 360 + 360) % 360;Then there are the following cases: [0, 44] degrees — no need to rotate, 45 degrees — 0 or 1 turn to minimum deviation, minimum is 0, [46, 134] degrees — one turn required, 135 degrees — 1 or 2 turns to minimum deviation, minimum is 1, [136, 224] degrees — two turns required, 225 degrees — 2 or 3 turns to minimum deviation, minimum is 2, [226, 314] degrees — three turns required, 315 degrees — 3 or 0 turns to minimum deviation, minimum is 0, [316, 359] degrees — no need to rotate. Let's add 44 degrees to the angle from the range [0, 359]. C++/Java code is angle = (angle + 44) % 360; Then the ranges will be: [0, 89] degrees — 0 turns, [90, 179] degrees — 1 turn, [180, 269] degrees — 2 turns, [270, 358] degrees — 3 turns, 359 degrees — 0 turns. One special case of 359 degrees can be eliminated by taking angle modulo 359. Then just integer division by 90 is required to get the answer. C++/Java code is answer = (angle % 359) / 90;N. ForecastThere is nothing special in solving a quadratic equation but the problem has one catch. You should output the greater root first.The simplest approach is to output max(x1, x2) first, then min(x1, x2).Another approach is based upon the sign of a. for a > 0 and for a < 0.We can divide all coefficients by a, and then the first coefficient will be positive. But notice that division should be done in a floating point type and a should be divided last otherwise resulting a / a = 1 would not be able to divide b and c.O. ArrowTo get a vector of the given length b in the direction of the given vector (vx, vy) it is just required to normalize the given vector (divide it by its length) and then multiply by b.Let's denote , vnx = vx / len, vny = vy / len. Then (vnx, vny) is the normalized vector, and the first point of the arrow is (px + vnx·b, py + vny·b).To get the second point of the arrow one needs to rotate the normalized vector 90 degrees counter-clockwise and then multiply by the half of the triangle base a / 2. Let's denote vlx =  - vny, vly = vnx. Then (vlx, vly) is the normalized vector 90 degrees counter-clockwise to (vnx, vny). So the second point of the arrow is (px + vlx·a / 2, py + vly·a / 2).The third point can be found the same way as the second point but the length of the vector to it is c / 2. So the third point of the arrow is (px + vlx·c / 2, py + vly·c / 2).The fourth point can be found by adding the vector of the length c / 2 to the left of the given and the vector of the length d reverse to the given. So the fourth point of the arrow is (px + vlx·c / 2 - vnx·d, py + vly·c / 2 - vny·d).The remaining points are symmetrical to the points discussed above so they can be obtained the same way, just using minus for (vlx, vly) instead of plus. So the next points are (px - vlx·c / 2 - vnx·d, py - vly·c / 2 - vny·d), (px - vlx·c / 2, py - vly·c / 2), (px - vlx·a / 2, py - vly·a / 2).P. Area of a Star where n in the number of the star corners because in a regular star all angles between corners are equal. because of symmetry. because it is an inscribed angle. because of symmetry.So we know OA = r and and . We can calculate the area of AOB triangle knowing the length of a side and two angles adjacent to it using formula .The whole star area is equal to 2n areas of AOB triangle because of symmetry. .Q. PyramidsThe volume of a pyramid can be calculated as where v is the volume, s is the area of the base and h is the height from the base to the apex. Let's calculate s and h.The area of a regular polygon having n sides of length ln can be found the following way.On the figure above a regular polygon is shown. O is the center of the polygon, all sides are equal to ln, OB is the altitude of AOC triangle. As the polygon is a regular one OA = OC, AOC triangle is a isosceles one and then and AB = BC, also AOB and COB triangles are right-angled ones. Also because the polygon is a regular one and can be seen as a union of 2n triangles equal to AOB triangle then .AOB triangle is right-angled one, so , . Also . So and . The area of AOB is equal to . The area of the polygon is .On the figure above a triangle formed by the pyramid apex H, the center of the base O and some vertex of the base A is shown. It is a right-angled one. As all edges of the pyramid are equal, AH = ln and from calculations above . According to Pythagorean theorem OA2 + OH2 = AH2. So .The volume of one piramid is .And the final formula is .R. GameFor the field of an even size there is a winning strategy for the second player. Namely, to paint a cell that is symmetrical with respect to the center of the field to the cell painted by the first player on the previous turn. After each turn of the second player the field is centrosymmetrical and so there is always a cell that can be painted that is symmetrical with respect to the center of the field to any cell that the first player can choose to paint. .... 1... .1.. .... ....\n.... .... .... 1... .1..\n.... .... .... ...2 ..2.\n.... ...2 ..2. .... ....For the field of an odd size there is a winning strategy for the first player. Namely, on the first turn to paint the central cell, then to paint a cell that is symmetrical with respect to the center of the field to the cell painted by the second player on the previous turn. After each turn of the first player the field is centrosymmetrical and so there is always a cell that can be painted that is symmetrical with respect to the center of the field to any cell that the second player can choose to paint. ..... 2.... .2... ..2.. .....\n..... ..... ..... ..... .2...\n..1.. ..1.. ..1.. ..1.. ..1..\n..... ..... ..... ..... ...1.\n..... ....1 ...1. ..1.. .....So for even n the answer is 2, for odd n the answer is 1. One of the possible formulas for the problem is .n can be up to 1018 so at least 64-bit integer type should be used to input it.",

          "content": "A. Again Twenty Five!The problem of getting the last two digits is equivalent to the problem of getting the number modulo 100. So we need to calculate . According to the rules of modular arithmeticSoLet's note that 52 = 25. ThenAnd so on. All are equal to 25 for all n ≥ 2.So to solve the problem one need to just output 25. There is no need to read n.B. Moore's LawEvery second the number is multiplied by 1.000000011. Multiplication several times to the same number is equivalent to exponentiation. So the formula is n·1.000000011t (1.000000011 raised to the power of t and then multiplied to n). In a program one should not use a loop to calculate power as it is too slow for such big n, usually a programming language provides a function for exponentiation such as pow.C. Lucky NumbersThere are 2 lucky numbers of the length 1. They are 7 and 8. There are 4 lucky numbers of the length 2. They are 77, 78, 87 and 88. There are 8 lucky numbers of the length 3. They are 777, 778, 787, 788, 877, 878, 887, 888. For each addition of 1 to the length the number of lucky numbers is increased times 2. It is easy to prove: to any number of the previous length one can append 7 or 8, so one number of the prevous length creates two numbers of the next length.So for the length n the amount of lucky numbers of the length exactly n is 2n. But in the problem we need the amount of lucky numbers of length not greater than n. Let's sum up them. 21 = 2, 21 + 22 = 2 + 4 = 6, 21 + 22 + 23 = 2 + 4 + 8 = 14, 21 + 22 + 23 + 24 = 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 30. One can notice that the sum of all previous powers of two is equal to the next power of two minus the first power of two. So the answer to the problem is 2n + 1 - 2.One of the possible implementations of 2n + 1 in a programming language is to shift 1 bitwise to the left for n + 1 binary digits or to shift 2 bitwise to the left for n binary digits. For example, in Java the problem answer formula is (2L << n) - 2, in C++ is (2LL << n) - 2. Suffixes L and LL correspondingly are required so that result of the shift expression have 64-bit integer type (long in Java and long long in C++). Type of the second operand does not matter for the type of shift expression, only the type of the first operand. Also parenthesis are required because without them subtraction is performed first and only then bitwise shift.D. Hexagons!Let's count the number of cells having the distance of exactly n. For n = 0 it is 1, for n = 1 it is 6, for n = 2 it is 12, for n = 3 it is 18 and so on. One can notice that n = 0 is a special case, and then the amount increases by addition of 6. These numbers form an arithmetic progression. In the problem we need to sum these numbers. The formula of the sum of an arithmetic progression is (first + last)·amount / 2. The first is 6, the last is 6n, the amount is n. So the sum is (6 + 6n)n / 2 = 3(n + 1)n. And plus 1 that is not in the arithmetic progression. So the final formula is 1 + 3n(n + 1).To avoid overflow, multiplication in the formula should be performed in 64-bit integer type. For this either 3 or 1 or n should have 64-bit integer type. The literals are 64-bit integer when they have suffix L in Java or LL in C++.E. A rectangleLet's see how the number of affected cells changes depending on the column. For example 3, 2, 3, 2, 3. That is it alternates between the size of the first column and the size of the first column minus one. The amount of \"minus ones\" is the amount of columns divided by 2 rounded down. Without \"minus ones\" all columns have equal size and the total amount of cells is equal to size of the first column multiplied by the number of the columns. The first column size is (y2 - y1) / 2 + 1. The columns amount is x2 - x1 + 1. So the final formula is ((y2 - y1) / 2 + 1)·(x2 - x1 + 1) - (x2 - x1) / 2.To avoid overflow, multiplication should be computed in 64-bit integer type.F. Selection of PersonnelThe amount of ways to choose a group of 5 people from n candidates is equal to the number of combinations , the amount of ways to choose a group of 6 people from n candidates is , the amount of ways to choose a group of 7 people from n candidates is , the amount of ways to choose a group of 5, 6 or 7 people from n candidates is .To avoid 64-bit integer overflow can be calculated in the following way: n / 1 * (n - 1) / 2 * (n - 2) / 3 * (n - 3) / 4 * (n - 4) / 5 * (n - 5) / 6 * (n - 6) / 7. Each division returns an integer because each prefix of this formula after division is also the number of combinations .G. Challenge PennantsFirst of all, ways to place both types of the pennants are independent. So each way to place \"I fixed a critical bug\" pennants on n tables is compatible to each way to place \"I suggested a new feature\" pennants on n tables. Therefore the answer of the problem is equal to the number of ways to place \"I fixed a critical bug\" pennants multiplied by the number of ways to place \"I suggested a new feature\" pennant.The number of ways to place k identical items into n different places when any place can contain any amount of items is the definition of the number of k-combinations with repetitions or k-multicombinations. The formula for the number is .So the whole formula for the problem is .To avoid overflow of 64-bit integer type recommended formulas for computation are (n + 2) / 1 * (n + 1) / 2 * n / 3 and (n + 4) / 1 * (n + 3) / 2 * (n + 2) / 3 * (n + 1) / 4 * n / 5.H. BenchesThe number of ways to choose 5 east to west paths that will have benches from n is . There are n ways to place a bench on the first of these paths. Given the place of the first bench there are n - 1 ways to place a bench on the second of these paths because one of north to south paths is already taken. Given the places of the first and second benches there are n - 2 ways to place a bench on the third of these paths because two of north to south paths are already taken. And the same way n - 3 and n - 4 for the fourth and the fifth benches. Total number of ways to place benches on selected 5 east to west path is n(n - 1)(n - 2)(n - 3)(n - 4). So the formula for the problem is .To avoid 64-bit integer overflow recommended order of computation is exactly as in the formula above, division should not be the last operation.I. Parking LotThere are the following ways to place n cars of the same make. They can be the first n, the last n, or they can be somewhere in the middle of the parking lot.When n cars of the same make are the first or the last, there are 4 ways to choose the make of these n cars, then there are 3 ways to choose the make of one car adjacent to them (the make should be different from the make of n cars) and there are 4 ways to choose the make of each of the remaining n - 3 cars. So the formula for the case of n cars of the same make on either end of the parking lot is 4·3·4n - 3.When n cars of the same make are situated somewhere in the middle, there are 4 ways to choose the make of these n cars, then there are 3 ways to choose the make of each of two cars adjacent to them (the makes of these two cars should be different from the make of n cars) and there are 4 ways to choose the make of each of the remaining n - 4 cars. So the formula for the case of n cars of the same make on a given position somewhere in the middle of the parking lot is 4·32·4n - 4.There are 2 positions of n cars of the same make in the end of the parking lot and there are n - 3 positions of n cars of the same make somewhere in the middle of the parking lot. So the final formula is 2·4·3·4n - 3 + (n - 3)·4·32·4n - 4.J. DivisibilityLet's factorize numbers from 2 to 10. 2 = 2, 3 = 3, 4 = 22, 5 = 5, 6 = 2·3, 7 = 7, 8 = 23, 9 = 32, 10 = 2·5. If a number is divisible by all numbers from 2 to 10, its factorization should contain 2 at least in the power of 3, 3 at least in the power of 2, 5 and 7 at least in the power of 1. So it can be written as x·23·32·5·7 = x·2520. So any number divisible by 2520 is divisible by all numbers from 2 to 10.There are numbers from 1 to n divisible by all numbers from 2 to 10. In a programming language it is usually implemented as simple integer division.K. IndivisibilityThe amount of numbers from 1 to n not divisible by any number from 2 to 10 is equal to the amount of all numbers from 1 to n (that is n) minus the amount of numbers from 1 to n divisible by some number from 2 to 10.The set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by some number from 2 to 10 can be found as union of the set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by 2, the set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by 3 and so on till 10.Note that sets of numbers divisible by 4 or 6 or 8 are subsets of the set of numbers divisible by 2, and sets of numbers divisible by 6 or 9 are subsets of the set of numbers divisible by 3. So there is no need to unite 9 sets, it is enough to unite sets for 2, 3, 5, 7 only.The size of set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by some of 2, 3, 5, 7 can be calculated using inclusion-exclusion principle that says that size of each single set should be added, size of pairwise intersections should be subtracted, size of all intersections of three sets should be added and so on.The size of set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by 2 is equal to , the size of set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by 2 and 3 is equal to and so on.The final formula is Division with rounding down in the formula in a programming language is usually just integer division.L. Cracking the CodeIn this problem just implementation of the actions described in the statement is required. However there are two catches in this problem.The first catch is that the fifth power of five-digit number cannot be represented by a 64-bit integer. But we need not the fifth power, we need the fifth power modulo 105. And mod operation can be applied after each multiplication (see problem A above).The second catch is that you need to output five digits, not the fifth power modulo 105. The difference is when fifth digit from the end is zero. To output a number with the leading zero one can either use corresponding formatting (%05d in printf) or extract digits and output them one by one.M. TurnFirst of all, let's reduce camera rotation angle to [0, 359] degrees range. It is accomplished by the following C++/Java code: angle = (angle % 360 + 360) % 360;Then there are the following cases: [0, 44] degrees — no need to rotate, 45 degrees — 0 or 1 turn to minimum deviation, minimum is 0, [46, 134] degrees — one turn required, 135 degrees — 1 or 2 turns to minimum deviation, minimum is 1, [136, 224] degrees — two turns required, 225 degrees — 2 or 3 turns to minimum deviation, minimum is 2, [226, 314] degrees — three turns required, 315 degrees — 3 or 0 turns to minimum deviation, minimum is 0, [316, 359] degrees — no need to rotate. Let's add 44 degrees to the angle from the range [0, 359]. C++/Java code is angle = (angle + 44) % 360; Then the ranges will be: [0, 89] degrees — 0 turns, [90, 179] degrees — 1 turn, [180, 269] degrees — 2 turns, [270, 358] degrees — 3 turns, 359 degrees — 0 turns. One special case of 359 degrees can be eliminated by taking angle modulo 359. Then just integer division by 90 is required to get the answer. C++/Java code is answer = (angle % 359) / 90;N. ForecastThere is nothing special in solving a quadratic equation but the problem has one catch. You should output the greater root first.The simplest approach is to output max(x1, x2) first, then min(x1, x2).Another approach is based upon the sign of a. for a > 0 and for a < 0.We can divide all coefficients by a, and then the first coefficient will be positive. But notice that division should be done in a floating point type and a should be divided last otherwise resulting a / a = 1 would not be able to divide b and c.O. ArrowTo get a vector of the given length b in the direction of the given vector (vx, vy) it is just required to normalize the given vector (divide it by its length) and then multiply by b.Let's denote , vnx = vx / len, vny = vy / len. Then (vnx, vny) is the normalized vector, and the first point of the arrow is (px + vnx·b, py + vny·b).To get the second point of the arrow one needs to rotate the normalized vector 90 degrees counter-clockwise and then multiply by the half of the triangle base a / 2. Let's denote vlx =  - vny, vly = vnx. Then (vlx, vly) is the normalized vector 90 degrees counter-clockwise to (vnx, vny). So the second point of the arrow is (px + vlx·a / 2, py + vly·a / 2).The third point can be found the same way as the second point but the length of the vector to it is c / 2. So the third point of the arrow is (px + vlx·c / 2, py + vly·c / 2).The fourth point can be found by adding the vector of the length c / 2 to the left of the given and the vector of the length d reverse to the given. So the fourth point of the arrow is (px + vlx·c / 2 - vnx·d, py + vly·c / 2 - vny·d).The remaining points are symmetrical to the points discussed above so they can be obtained the same way, just using minus for (vlx, vly) instead of plus. So the next points are (px - vlx·c / 2 - vnx·d, py - vly·c / 2 - vny·d), (px - vlx·c / 2, py - vly·c / 2), (px - vlx·a / 2, py - vly·a / 2).P. Area of a Star where n in the number of the star corners because in a regular star all angles between corners are equal. because of symmetry. because it is an inscribed angle. because of symmetry.So we know OA = r and and . We can calculate the area of AOB triangle knowing the length of a side and two angles adjacent to it using formula .The whole star area is equal to 2n areas of AOB triangle because of symmetry. .Q. PyramidsThe volume of a pyramid can be calculated as where v is the volume, s is the area of the base and h is the height from the base to the apex. Let's calculate s and h.The area of a regular polygon having n sides of length ln can be found the following way.On the figure above a regular polygon is shown. O is the center of the polygon, all sides are equal to ln, OB is the altitude of AOC triangle. As the polygon is a regular one OA = OC, AOC triangle is a isosceles one and then and AB = BC, also AOB and COB triangles are right-angled ones. Also because the polygon is a regular one and can be seen as a union of 2n triangles equal to AOB triangle then .AOB triangle is right-angled one, so , . Also . So and . The area of AOB is equal to . The area of the polygon is .On the figure above a triangle formed by the pyramid apex H, the center of the base O and some vertex of the base A is shown. It is a right-angled one. As all edges of the pyramid are equal, AH = ln and from calculations above . According to Pythagorean theorem OA2 + OH2 = AH2. So .The volume of one piramid is .And the final formula is .R. GameFor the field of an even size there is a winning strategy for the second player. Namely, to paint a cell that is symmetrical with respect to the center of the field to the cell painted by the first player on the previous turn. After each turn of the second player the field is centrosymmetrical and so there is always a cell that can be painted that is symmetrical with respect to the center of the field to any cell that the first player can choose to paint. .... 1... .1.. .... ....\n.... .... .... 1... .1..\n.... .... .... ...2 ..2.\n.... ...2 ..2. .... ....For the field of an odd size there is a winning strategy for the first player. Namely, on the first turn to paint the central cell, then to paint a cell that is symmetrical with respect to the center of the field to the cell painted by the second player on the previous turn. After each turn of the first player the field is centrosymmetrical and so there is always a cell that can be painted that is symmetrical with respect to the center of the field to any cell that the second player can choose to paint. ..... 2.... .2... ..2.. .....\n..... ..... ..... ..... .2...\n..1.. ..1.. ..1.. ..1.. ..1..\n..... ..... ..... ..... ...1.\n..... ....1 ...1. ..1.. .....So for even n the answer is 2, for odd n the answer is 1. One of the possible formulas for the problem is .n can be up to 1018 so at least 64-bit integer type should be used to input it.",

          "content": "A. Again Twenty Five!The problem of getting the last two digits is equivalent to the problem of getting the number modulo 100. So we need to calculate . According to the rules of modular arithmeticSoLet's note that 52 = 25. ThenAnd so on. All are equal to 25 for all n ≥ 2.So to solve the problem one need to just output 25. There is no need to read n.B. Moore's LawEvery second the number is multiplied by 1.000000011. Multiplication several times to the same number is equivalent to exponentiation. So the formula is n·1.000000011t (1.000000011 raised to the power of t and then multiplied to n). In a program one should not use a loop to calculate power as it is too slow for such big n, usually a programming language provides a function for exponentiation such as pow.C. Lucky NumbersThere are 2 lucky numbers of the length 1. They are 7 and 8. There are 4 lucky numbers of the length 2. They are 77, 78, 87 and 88. There are 8 lucky numbers of the length 3. They are 777, 778, 787, 788, 877, 878, 887, 888. For each addition of 1 to the length the number of lucky numbers is increased times 2. It is easy to prove: to any number of the previous length one can append 7 or 8, so one number of the prevous length creates two numbers of the next length.So for the length n the amount of lucky numbers of the length exactly n is 2n. But in the problem we need the amount of lucky numbers of length not greater than n. Let's sum up them. 21 = 2, 21 + 22 = 2 + 4 = 6, 21 + 22 + 23 = 2 + 4 + 8 = 14, 21 + 22 + 23 + 24 = 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 30. One can notice that the sum of all previous powers of two is equal to the next power of two minus the first power of two. So the answer to the problem is 2n + 1 - 2.One of the possible implementations of 2n + 1 in a programming language is to shift 1 bitwise to the left for n + 1 binary digits or to shift 2 bitwise to the left for n binary digits. For example, in Java the problem answer formula is (2L << n) - 2, in C++ is (2LL << n) - 2. Suffixes L and LL correspondingly are required so that result of the shift expression have 64-bit integer type (long in Java and long long in C++). Type of the second operand does not matter for the type of shift expression, only the type of the first operand. Also parenthesis are required because without them subtraction is performed first and only then bitwise shift.D. Hexagons!Let's count the number of cells having the distance of exactly n. For n = 0 it is 1, for n = 1 it is 6, for n = 2 it is 12, for n = 3 it is 18 and so on. One can notice that n = 0 is a special case, and then the amount increases by addition of 6. These numbers form an arithmetic progression. In the problem we need to sum these numbers. The formula of the sum of an arithmetic progression is (first + last)·amount / 2. The first is 6, the last is 6n, the amount is n. So the sum is (6 + 6n)n / 2 = 3(n + 1)n. And plus 1 that is not in the arithmetic progression. So the final formula is 1 + 3n(n + 1).To avoid overflow, multiplication in the formula should be performed in 64-bit integer type. For this either 3 or 1 or n should have 64-bit integer type. The literals are 64-bit integer when they have suffix L in Java or LL in C++.E. A rectangleLet's see how the number of affected cells changes depending on the column. For example 3, 2, 3, 2, 3. That is it alternates between the size of the first column and the size of the first column minus one. The amount of \"minus ones\" is the amount of columns divided by 2 rounded down. Without \"minus ones\" all columns have equal size and the total amount of cells is equal to size of the first column multiplied by the number of the columns. The first column size is (y2 - y1) / 2 + 1. The columns amount is x2 - x1 + 1. So the final formula is ((y2 - y1) / 2 + 1)·(x2 - x1 + 1) - (x2 - x1) / 2.To avoid overflow, multiplication should be computed in 64-bit integer type.F. Selection of PersonnelThe amount of ways to choose a group of 5 people from n candidates is equal to the number of combinations , the amount of ways to choose a group of 6 people from n candidates is , the amount of ways to choose a group of 7 people from n candidates is , the amount of ways to choose a group of 5, 6 or 7 people from n candidates is .To avoid 64-bit integer overflow can be calculated in the following way: n / 1 * (n - 1) / 2 * (n - 2) / 3 * (n - 3) / 4 * (n - 4) / 5 * (n - 5) / 6 * (n - 6) / 7. Each division returns an integer because each prefix of this formula after division is also the number of combinations .G. Challenge PennantsFirst of all, ways to place both types of the pennants are independent. So each way to place \"I fixed a critical bug\" pennants on n tables is compatible to each way to place \"I suggested a new feature\" pennants on n tables. Therefore the answer of the problem is equal to the number of ways to place \"I fixed a critical bug\" pennants multiplied by the number of ways to place \"I suggested a new feature\" pennant.The number of ways to place k identical items into n different places when any place can contain any amount of items is the definition of the number of k-combinations with repetitions or k-multicombinations. The formula for the number is .So the whole formula for the problem is .To avoid overflow of 64-bit integer type recommended formulas for computation are (n + 2) / 1 * (n + 1) / 2 * n / 3 and (n + 4) / 1 * (n + 3) / 2 * (n + 2) / 3 * (n + 1) / 4 * n / 5.H. BenchesThe number of ways to choose 5 east to west paths that will have benches from n is . There are n ways to place a bench on the first of these paths. Given the place of the first bench there are n - 1 ways to place a bench on the second of these paths because one of north to south paths is already taken. Given the places of the first and second benches there are n - 2 ways to place a bench on the third of these paths because two of north to south paths are already taken. And the same way n - 3 and n - 4 for the fourth and the fifth benches. Total number of ways to place benches on selected 5 east to west path is n(n - 1)(n - 2)(n - 3)(n - 4). So the formula for the problem is .To avoid 64-bit integer overflow recommended order of computation is exactly as in the formula above, division should not be the last operation.I. Parking LotThere are the following ways to place n cars of the same make. They can be the first n, the last n, or they can be somewhere in the middle of the parking lot.When n cars of the same make are the first or the last, there are 4 ways to choose the make of these n cars, then there are 3 ways to choose the make of one car adjacent to them (the make should be different from the make of n cars) and there are 4 ways to choose the make of each of the remaining n - 3 cars. So the formula for the case of n cars of the same make on either end of the parking lot is 4·3·4n - 3.When n cars of the same make are situated somewhere in the middle, there are 4 ways to choose the make of these n cars, then there are 3 ways to choose the make of each of two cars adjacent to them (the makes of these two cars should be different from the make of n cars) and there are 4 ways to choose the make of each of the remaining n - 4 cars. So the formula for the case of n cars of the same make on a given position somewhere in the middle of the parking lot is 4·32·4n - 4.There are 2 positions of n cars of the same make in the end of the parking lot and there are n - 3 positions of n cars of the same make somewhere in the middle of the parking lot. So the final formula is 2·4·3·4n - 3 + (n - 3)·4·32·4n - 4.J. DivisibilityLet's factorize numbers from 2 to 10. 2 = 2, 3 = 3, 4 = 22, 5 = 5, 6 = 2·3, 7 = 7, 8 = 23, 9 = 32, 10 = 2·5. If a number is divisible by all numbers from 2 to 10, its factorization should contain 2 at least in the power of 3, 3 at least in the power of 2, 5 and 7 at least in the power of 1. So it can be written as x·23·32·5·7 = x·2520. So any number divisible by 2520 is divisible by all numbers from 2 to 10.There are numbers from 1 to n divisible by all numbers from 2 to 10. In a programming language it is usually implemented as simple integer division.K. IndivisibilityThe amount of numbers from 1 to n not divisible by any number from 2 to 10 is equal to the amount of all numbers from 1 to n (that is n) minus the amount of numbers from 1 to n divisible by some number from 2 to 10.The set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by some number from 2 to 10 can be found as union of the set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by 2, the set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by 3 and so on till 10.Note that sets of numbers divisible by 4 or 6 or 8 are subsets of the set of numbers divisible by 2, and sets of numbers divisible by 6 or 9 are subsets of the set of numbers divisible by 3. So there is no need to unite 9 sets, it is enough to unite sets for 2, 3, 5, 7 only.The size of set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by some of 2, 3, 5, 7 can be calculated using inclusion-exclusion principle that says that size of each single set should be added, size of pairwise intersections should be subtracted, size of all intersections of three sets should be added and so on.The size of set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by 2 is equal to , the size of set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by 2 and 3 is equal to and so on.The final formula is Division with rounding down in the formula in a programming language is usually just integer division.L. Cracking the CodeIn this problem just implementation of the actions described in the statement is required. However there are two catches in this problem.The first catch is that the fifth power of five-digit number cannot be represented by a 64-bit integer. But we need not the fifth power, we need the fifth power modulo 105. And mod operation can be applied after each multiplication (see problem A above).The second catch is that you need to output five digits, not the fifth power modulo 105. The difference is when fifth digit from the end is zero. To output a number with the leading zero one can either use corresponding formatting (%05d in printf) or extract digits and output them one by one.M. TurnFirst of all, let's reduce camera rotation angle to [0, 359] degrees range. It is accomplished by the following C++/Java code: angle = (angle % 360 + 360) % 360;Then there are the following cases: [0, 44] degrees — no need to rotate, 45 degrees — 0 or 1 turn to minimum deviation, minimum is 0, [46, 134] degrees — one turn required, 135 degrees — 1 or 2 turns to minimum deviation, minimum is 1, [136, 224] degrees — two turns required, 225 degrees — 2 or 3 turns to minimum deviation, minimum is 2, [226, 314] degrees — three turns required, 315 degrees — 3 or 0 turns to minimum deviation, minimum is 0, [316, 359] degrees — no need to rotate. Let's add 44 degrees to the angle from the range [0, 359]. C++/Java code is angle = (angle + 44) % 360; Then the ranges will be: [0, 89] degrees — 0 turns, [90, 179] degrees — 1 turn, [180, 269] degrees — 2 turns, [270, 358] degrees — 3 turns, 359 degrees — 0 turns. One special case of 359 degrees can be eliminated by taking angle modulo 359. Then just integer division by 90 is required to get the answer. C++/Java code is answer = (angle % 359) / 90;N. ForecastThere is nothing special in solving a quadratic equation but the problem has one catch. You should output the greater root first.The simplest approach is to output max(x1, x2) first, then min(x1, x2).Another approach is based upon the sign of a. for a > 0 and for a < 0.We can divide all coefficients by a, and then the first coefficient will be positive. But notice that division should be done in a floating point type and a should be divided last otherwise resulting a / a = 1 would not be able to divide b and c.O. ArrowTo get a vector of the given length b in the direction of the given vector (vx, vy) it is just required to normalize the given vector (divide it by its length) and then multiply by b.Let's denote , vnx = vx / len, vny = vy / len. Then (vnx, vny) is the normalized vector, and the first point of the arrow is (px + vnx·b, py + vny·b).To get the second point of the arrow one needs to rotate the normalized vector 90 degrees counter-clockwise and then multiply by the half of the triangle base a / 2. Let's denote vlx =  - vny, vly = vnx. Then (vlx, vly) is the normalized vector 90 degrees counter-clockwise to (vnx, vny). So the second point of the arrow is (px + vlx·a / 2, py + vly·a / 2).The third point can be found the same way as the second point but the length of the vector to it is c / 2. So the third point of the arrow is (px + vlx·c / 2, py + vly·c / 2).The fourth point can be found by adding the vector of the length c / 2 to the left of the given and the vector of the length d reverse to the given. So the fourth point of the arrow is (px + vlx·c / 2 - vnx·d, py + vly·c / 2 - vny·d).The remaining points are symmetrical to the points discussed above so they can be obtained the same way, just using minus for (vlx, vly) instead of plus. So the next points are (px - vlx·c / 2 - vnx·d, py - vly·c / 2 - vny·d), (px - vlx·c / 2, py - vly·c / 2), (px - vlx·a / 2, py - vly·a / 2).P. Area of a Star where n in the number of the star corners because in a regular star all angles between corners are equal. because of symmetry. because it is an inscribed angle. because of symmetry.So we know OA = r and and . We can calculate the area of AOB triangle knowing the length of a side and two angles adjacent to it using formula .The whole star area is equal to 2n areas of AOB triangle because of symmetry. .Q. PyramidsThe volume of a pyramid can be calculated as where v is the volume, s is the area of the base and h is the height from the base to the apex. Let's calculate s and h.The area of a regular polygon having n sides of length ln can be found the following way.On the figure above a regular polygon is shown. O is the center of the polygon, all sides are equal to ln, OB is the altitude of AOC triangle. As the polygon is a regular one OA = OC, AOC triangle is a isosceles one and then and AB = BC, also AOB and COB triangles are right-angled ones. Also because the polygon is a regular one and can be seen as a union of 2n triangles equal to AOB triangle then .AOB triangle is right-angled one, so , . Also . So and . The area of AOB is equal to . The area of the polygon is .On the figure above a triangle formed by the pyramid apex H, the center of the base O and some vertex of the base A is shown. It is a right-angled one. As all edges of the pyramid are equal, AH = ln and from calculations above . According to Pythagorean theorem OA2 + OH2 = AH2. So .The volume of one piramid is .And the final formula is .R. GameFor the field of an even size there is a winning strategy for the second player. Namely, to paint a cell that is symmetrical with respect to the center of the field to the cell painted by the first player on the previous turn. After each turn of the second player the field is centrosymmetrical and so there is always a cell that can be painted that is symmetrical with respect to the center of the field to any cell that the first player can choose to paint. .... 1... .1.. .... ....\n.... .... .... 1... .1..\n.... .... .... ...2 ..2.\n.... ...2 ..2. .... ....For the field of an odd size there is a winning strategy for the first player. Namely, on the first turn to paint the central cell, then to paint a cell that is symmetrical with respect to the center of the field to the cell painted by the second player on the previous turn. After each turn of the first player the field is centrosymmetrical and so there is always a cell that can be painted that is symmetrical with respect to the center of the field to any cell that the second player can choose to paint. ..... 2.... .2... ..2.. .....\n..... ..... ..... ..... .2...\n..1.. ..1.. ..1.. ..1.. ..1..\n..... ..... ..... ..... ...1.\n..... ....1 ...1. ..1.. .....So for even n the answer is 2, for odd n the answer is 1. One of the possible formulas for the problem is .n can be up to 1018 so at least 64-bit integer type should be used to input it.",

          "content": "A. Again Twenty Five!The problem of getting the last two digits is equivalent to the problem of getting the number modulo 100. So we need to calculate . According to the rules of modular arithmeticSoLet's note that 52 = 25. ThenAnd so on. All are equal to 25 for all n ≥ 2.So to solve the problem one need to just output 25. There is no need to read n.B. Moore's LawEvery second the number is multiplied by 1.000000011. Multiplication several times to the same number is equivalent to exponentiation. So the formula is n·1.000000011t (1.000000011 raised to the power of t and then multiplied to n). In a program one should not use a loop to calculate power as it is too slow for such big n, usually a programming language provides a function for exponentiation such as pow.C. Lucky NumbersThere are 2 lucky numbers of the length 1. They are 7 and 8. There are 4 lucky numbers of the length 2. They are 77, 78, 87 and 88. There are 8 lucky numbers of the length 3. They are 777, 778, 787, 788, 877, 878, 887, 888. For each addition of 1 to the length the number of lucky numbers is increased times 2. It is easy to prove: to any number of the previous length one can append 7 or 8, so one number of the prevous length creates two numbers of the next length.So for the length n the amount of lucky numbers of the length exactly n is 2n. But in the problem we need the amount of lucky numbers of length not greater than n. Let's sum up them. 21 = 2, 21 + 22 = 2 + 4 = 6, 21 + 22 + 23 = 2 + 4 + 8 = 14, 21 + 22 + 23 + 24 = 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 30. One can notice that the sum of all previous powers of two is equal to the next power of two minus the first power of two. So the answer to the problem is 2n + 1 - 2.One of the possible implementations of 2n + 1 in a programming language is to shift 1 bitwise to the left for n + 1 binary digits or to shift 2 bitwise to the left for n binary digits. For example, in Java the problem answer formula is (2L << n) - 2, in C++ is (2LL << n) - 2. Suffixes L and LL correspondingly are required so that result of the shift expression have 64-bit integer type (long in Java and long long in C++). Type of the second operand does not matter for the type of shift expression, only the type of the first operand. Also parenthesis are required because without them subtraction is performed first and only then bitwise shift.D. Hexagons!Let's count the number of cells having the distance of exactly n. For n = 0 it is 1, for n = 1 it is 6, for n = 2 it is 12, for n = 3 it is 18 and so on. One can notice that n = 0 is a special case, and then the amount increases by addition of 6. These numbers form an arithmetic progression. In the problem we need to sum these numbers. The formula of the sum of an arithmetic progression is (first + last)·amount / 2. The first is 6, the last is 6n, the amount is n. So the sum is (6 + 6n)n / 2 = 3(n + 1)n. And plus 1 that is not in the arithmetic progression. So the final formula is 1 + 3n(n + 1).To avoid overflow, multiplication in the formula should be performed in 64-bit integer type. For this either 3 or 1 or n should have 64-bit integer type. The literals are 64-bit integer when they have suffix L in Java or LL in C++.E. A rectangleLet's see how the number of affected cells changes depending on the column. For example 3, 2, 3, 2, 3. That is it alternates between the size of the first column and the size of the first column minus one. The amount of \"minus ones\" is the amount of columns divided by 2 rounded down. Without \"minus ones\" all columns have equal size and the total amount of cells is equal to size of the first column multiplied by the number of the columns. The first column size is (y2 - y1) / 2 + 1. The columns amount is x2 - x1 + 1. So the final formula is ((y2 - y1) / 2 + 1)·(x2 - x1 + 1) - (x2 - x1) / 2.To avoid overflow, multiplication should be computed in 64-bit integer type.F. Selection of PersonnelThe amount of ways to choose a group of 5 people from n candidates is equal to the number of combinations , the amount of ways to choose a group of 6 people from n candidates is , the amount of ways to choose a group of 7 people from n candidates is , the amount of ways to choose a group of 5, 6 or 7 people from n candidates is .To avoid 64-bit integer overflow can be calculated in the following way: n / 1 * (n - 1) / 2 * (n - 2) / 3 * (n - 3) / 4 * (n - 4) / 5 * (n - 5) / 6 * (n - 6) / 7. Each division returns an integer because each prefix of this formula after division is also the number of combinations .G. Challenge PennantsFirst of all, ways to place both types of the pennants are independent. So each way to place \"I fixed a critical bug\" pennants on n tables is compatible to each way to place \"I suggested a new feature\" pennants on n tables. Therefore the answer of the problem is equal to the number of ways to place \"I fixed a critical bug\" pennants multiplied by the number of ways to place \"I suggested a new feature\" pennant.The number of ways to place k identical items into n different places when any place can contain any amount of items is the definition of the number of k-combinations with repetitions or k-multicombinations. The formula for the number is .So the whole formula for the problem is .To avoid overflow of 64-bit integer type recommended formulas for computation are (n + 2) / 1 * (n + 1) / 2 * n / 3 and (n + 4) / 1 * (n + 3) / 2 * (n + 2) / 3 * (n + 1) / 4 * n / 5.H. BenchesThe number of ways to choose 5 east to west paths that will have benches from n is . There are n ways to place a bench on the first of these paths. Given the place of the first bench there are n - 1 ways to place a bench on the second of these paths because one of north to south paths is already taken. Given the places of the first and second benches there are n - 2 ways to place a bench on the third of these paths because two of north to south paths are already taken. And the same way n - 3 and n - 4 for the fourth and the fifth benches. Total number of ways to place benches on selected 5 east to west path is n(n - 1)(n - 2)(n - 3)(n - 4). So the formula for the problem is .To avoid 64-bit integer overflow recommended order of computation is exactly as in the formula above, division should not be the last operation.I. Parking LotThere are the following ways to place n cars of the same make. They can be the first n, the last n, or they can be somewhere in the middle of the parking lot.When n cars of the same make are the first or the last, there are 4 ways to choose the make of these n cars, then there are 3 ways to choose the make of one car adjacent to them (the make should be different from the make of n cars) and there are 4 ways to choose the make of each of the remaining n - 3 cars. So the formula for the case of n cars of the same make on either end of the parking lot is 4·3·4n - 3.When n cars of the same make are situated somewhere in the middle, there are 4 ways to choose the make of these n cars, then there are 3 ways to choose the make of each of two cars adjacent to them (the makes of these two cars should be different from the make of n cars) and there are 4 ways to choose the make of each of the remaining n - 4 cars. So the formula for the case of n cars of the same make on a given position somewhere in the middle of the parking lot is 4·32·4n - 4.There are 2 positions of n cars of the same make in the end of the parking lot and there are n - 3 positions of n cars of the same make somewhere in the middle of the parking lot. So the final formula is 2·4·3·4n - 3 + (n - 3)·4·32·4n - 4.J. DivisibilityLet's factorize numbers from 2 to 10. 2 = 2, 3 = 3, 4 = 22, 5 = 5, 6 = 2·3, 7 = 7, 8 = 23, 9 = 32, 10 = 2·5. If a number is divisible by all numbers from 2 to 10, its factorization should contain 2 at least in the power of 3, 3 at least in the power of 2, 5 and 7 at least in the power of 1. So it can be written as x·23·32·5·7 = x·2520. So any number divisible by 2520 is divisible by all numbers from 2 to 10.There are numbers from 1 to n divisible by all numbers from 2 to 10. In a programming language it is usually implemented as simple integer division.K. IndivisibilityThe amount of numbers from 1 to n not divisible by any number from 2 to 10 is equal to the amount of all numbers from 1 to n (that is n) minus the amount of numbers from 1 to n divisible by some number from 2 to 10.The set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by some number from 2 to 10 can be found as union of the set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by 2, the set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by 3 and so on till 10.Note that sets of numbers divisible by 4 or 6 or 8 are subsets of the set of numbers divisible by 2, and sets of numbers divisible by 6 or 9 are subsets of the set of numbers divisible by 3. So there is no need to unite 9 sets, it is enough to unite sets for 2, 3, 5, 7 only.The size of set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by some of 2, 3, 5, 7 can be calculated using inclusion-exclusion principle that says that size of each single set should be added, size of pairwise intersections should be subtracted, size of all intersections of three sets should be added and so on.The size of set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by 2 is equal to , the size of set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by 2 and 3 is equal to and so on.The final formula is Division with rounding down in the formula in a programming language is usually just integer division.L. Cracking the CodeIn this problem just implementation of the actions described in the statement is required. However there are two catches in this problem.The first catch is that the fifth power of five-digit number cannot be represented by a 64-bit integer. But we need not the fifth power, we need the fifth power modulo 105. And mod operation can be applied after each multiplication (see problem A above).The second catch is that you need to output five digits, not the fifth power modulo 105. The difference is when fifth digit from the end is zero. To output a number with the leading zero one can either use corresponding formatting (%05d in printf) or extract digits and output them one by one.M. TurnFirst of all, let's reduce camera rotation angle to [0, 359] degrees range. It is accomplished by the following C++/Java code: angle = (angle % 360 + 360) % 360;Then there are the following cases: [0, 44] degrees — no need to rotate, 45 degrees — 0 or 1 turn to minimum deviation, minimum is 0, [46, 134] degrees — one turn required, 135 degrees — 1 or 2 turns to minimum deviation, minimum is 1, [136, 224] degrees — two turns required, 225 degrees — 2 or 3 turns to minimum deviation, minimum is 2, [226, 314] degrees — three turns required, 315 degrees — 3 or 0 turns to minimum deviation, minimum is 0, [316, 359] degrees — no need to rotate. Let's add 44 degrees to the angle from the range [0, 359]. C++/Java code is angle = (angle + 44) % 360; Then the ranges will be: [0, 89] degrees — 0 turns, [90, 179] degrees — 1 turn, [180, 269] degrees — 2 turns, [270, 358] degrees — 3 turns, 359 degrees — 0 turns. One special case of 359 degrees can be eliminated by taking angle modulo 359. Then just integer division by 90 is required to get the answer. C++/Java code is answer = (angle % 359) / 90;N. ForecastThere is nothing special in solving a quadratic equation but the problem has one catch. You should output the greater root first.The simplest approach is to output max(x1, x2) first, then min(x1, x2).Another approach is based upon the sign of a. for a > 0 and for a < 0.We can divide all coefficients by a, and then the first coefficient will be positive. But notice that division should be done in a floating point type and a should be divided last otherwise resulting a / a = 1 would not be able to divide b and c.O. ArrowTo get a vector of the given length b in the direction of the given vector (vx, vy) it is just required to normalize the given vector (divide it by its length) and then multiply by b.Let's denote , vnx = vx / len, vny = vy / len. Then (vnx, vny) is the normalized vector, and the first point of the arrow is (px + vnx·b, py + vny·b).To get the second point of the arrow one needs to rotate the normalized vector 90 degrees counter-clockwise and then multiply by the half of the triangle base a / 2. Let's denote vlx =  - vny, vly = vnx. Then (vlx, vly) is the normalized vector 90 degrees counter-clockwise to (vnx, vny). So the second point of the arrow is (px + vlx·a / 2, py + vly·a / 2).The third point can be found the same way as the second point but the length of the vector to it is c / 2. So the third point of the arrow is (px + vlx·c / 2, py + vly·c / 2).The fourth point can be found by adding the vector of the length c / 2 to the left of the given and the vector of the length d reverse to the given. So the fourth point of the arrow is (px + vlx·c / 2 - vnx·d, py + vly·c / 2 - vny·d).The remaining points are symmetrical to the points discussed above so they can be obtained the same way, just using minus for (vlx, vly) instead of plus. So the next points are (px - vlx·c / 2 - vnx·d, py - vly·c / 2 - vny·d), (px - vlx·c / 2, py - vly·c / 2), (px - vlx·a / 2, py - vly·a / 2).P. Area of a Star where n in the number of the star corners because in a regular star all angles between corners are equal. because of symmetry. because it is an inscribed angle. because of symmetry.So we know OA = r and and . We can calculate the area of AOB triangle knowing the length of a side and two angles adjacent to it using formula .The whole star area is equal to 2n areas of AOB triangle because of symmetry. .Q. PyramidsThe volume of a pyramid can be calculated as where v is the volume, s is the area of the base and h is the height from the base to the apex. Let's calculate s and h.The area of a regular polygon having n sides of length ln can be found the following way.On the figure above a regular polygon is shown. O is the center of the polygon, all sides are equal to ln, OB is the altitude of AOC triangle. As the polygon is a regular one OA = OC, AOC triangle is a isosceles one and then and AB = BC, also AOB and COB triangles are right-angled ones. Also because the polygon is a regular one and can be seen as a union of 2n triangles equal to AOB triangle then .AOB triangle is right-angled one, so , . Also . So and . The area of AOB is equal to . The area of the polygon is .On the figure above a triangle formed by the pyramid apex H, the center of the base O and some vertex of the base A is shown. It is a right-angled one. As all edges of the pyramid are equal, AH = ln and from calculations above . According to Pythagorean theorem OA2 + OH2 = AH2. So .The volume of one piramid is .And the final formula is .R. GameFor the field of an even size there is a winning strategy for the second player. Namely, to paint a cell that is symmetrical with respect to the center of the field to the cell painted by the first player on the previous turn. After each turn of the second player the field is centrosymmetrical and so there is always a cell that can be painted that is symmetrical with respect to the center of the field to any cell that the first player can choose to paint. .... 1... .1.. .... ....\n.... .... .... 1... .1..\n.... .... .... ...2 ..2.\n.... ...2 ..2. .... ....For the field of an odd size there is a winning strategy for the first player. Namely, on the first turn to paint the central cell, then to paint a cell that is symmetrical with respect to the center of the field to the cell painted by the second player on the previous turn. After each turn of the first player the field is centrosymmetrical and so there is always a cell that can be painted that is symmetrical with respect to the center of the field to any cell that the second player can choose to paint. ..... 2.... .2... ..2.. .....\n..... ..... ..... ..... .2...\n..1.. ..1.. ..1.. ..1.. ..1..\n..... ..... ..... ..... ...1.\n..... ....1 ...1. ..1.. .....So for even n the answer is 2, for odd n the answer is 1. One of the possible formulas for the problem is .n can be up to 1018 so at least 64-bit integer type should be used to input it.",

          "content": "A. Again Twenty Five!The problem of getting the last two digits is equivalent to the problem of getting the number modulo 100. So we need to calculate . According to the rules of modular arithmeticSoLet's note that 52 = 25. ThenAnd so on. All are equal to 25 for all n ≥ 2.So to solve the problem one need to just output 25. There is no need to read n.B. Moore's LawEvery second the number is multiplied by 1.000000011. Multiplication several times to the same number is equivalent to exponentiation. So the formula is n·1.000000011t (1.000000011 raised to the power of t and then multiplied to n). In a program one should not use a loop to calculate power as it is too slow for such big n, usually a programming language provides a function for exponentiation such as pow.C. Lucky NumbersThere are 2 lucky numbers of the length 1. They are 7 and 8. There are 4 lucky numbers of the length 2. They are 77, 78, 87 and 88. There are 8 lucky numbers of the length 3. They are 777, 778, 787, 788, 877, 878, 887, 888. For each addition of 1 to the length the number of lucky numbers is increased times 2. It is easy to prove: to any number of the previous length one can append 7 or 8, so one number of the prevous length creates two numbers of the next length.So for the length n the amount of lucky numbers of the length exactly n is 2n. But in the problem we need the amount of lucky numbers of length not greater than n. Let's sum up them. 21 = 2, 21 + 22 = 2 + 4 = 6, 21 + 22 + 23 = 2 + 4 + 8 = 14, 21 + 22 + 23 + 24 = 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 30. One can notice that the sum of all previous powers of two is equal to the next power of two minus the first power of two. So the answer to the problem is 2n + 1 - 2.One of the possible implementations of 2n + 1 in a programming language is to shift 1 bitwise to the left for n + 1 binary digits or to shift 2 bitwise to the left for n binary digits. For example, in Java the problem answer formula is (2L << n) - 2, in C++ is (2LL << n) - 2. Suffixes L and LL correspondingly are required so that result of the shift expression have 64-bit integer type (long in Java and long long in C++). Type of the second operand does not matter for the type of shift expression, only the type of the first operand. Also parenthesis are required because without them subtraction is performed first and only then bitwise shift.D. Hexagons!Let's count the number of cells having the distance of exactly n. For n = 0 it is 1, for n = 1 it is 6, for n = 2 it is 12, for n = 3 it is 18 and so on. One can notice that n = 0 is a special case, and then the amount increases by addition of 6. These numbers form an arithmetic progression. In the problem we need to sum these numbers. The formula of the sum of an arithmetic progression is (first + last)·amount / 2. The first is 6, the last is 6n, the amount is n. So the sum is (6 + 6n)n / 2 = 3(n + 1)n. And plus 1 that is not in the arithmetic progression. So the final formula is 1 + 3n(n + 1).To avoid overflow, multiplication in the formula should be performed in 64-bit integer type. For this either 3 or 1 or n should have 64-bit integer type. The literals are 64-bit integer when they have suffix L in Java or LL in C++.E. A rectangleLet's see how the number of affected cells changes depending on the column. For example 3, 2, 3, 2, 3. That is it alternates between the size of the first column and the size of the first column minus one. The amount of \"minus ones\" is the amount of columns divided by 2 rounded down. Without \"minus ones\" all columns have equal size and the total amount of cells is equal to size of the first column multiplied by the number of the columns. The first column size is (y2 - y1) / 2 + 1. The columns amount is x2 - x1 + 1. So the final formula is ((y2 - y1) / 2 + 1)·(x2 - x1 + 1) - (x2 - x1) / 2.To avoid overflow, multiplication should be computed in 64-bit integer type.F. Selection of PersonnelThe amount of ways to choose a group of 5 people from n candidates is equal to the number of combinations , the amount of ways to choose a group of 6 people from n candidates is , the amount of ways to choose a group of 7 people from n candidates is , the amount of ways to choose a group of 5, 6 or 7 people from n candidates is .To avoid 64-bit integer overflow can be calculated in the following way: n / 1 * (n - 1) / 2 * (n - 2) / 3 * (n - 3) / 4 * (n - 4) / 5 * (n - 5) / 6 * (n - 6) / 7. Each division returns an integer because each prefix of this formula after division is also the number of combinations .G. Challenge PennantsFirst of all, ways to place both types of the pennants are independent. So each way to place \"I fixed a critical bug\" pennants on n tables is compatible to each way to place \"I suggested a new feature\" pennants on n tables. Therefore the answer of the problem is equal to the number of ways to place \"I fixed a critical bug\" pennants multiplied by the number of ways to place \"I suggested a new feature\" pennant.The number of ways to place k identical items into n different places when any place can contain any amount of items is the definition of the number of k-combinations with repetitions or k-multicombinations. The formula for the number is .So the whole formula for the problem is .To avoid overflow of 64-bit integer type recommended formulas for computation are (n + 2) / 1 * (n + 1) / 2 * n / 3 and (n + 4) / 1 * (n + 3) / 2 * (n + 2) / 3 * (n + 1) / 4 * n / 5.H. BenchesThe number of ways to choose 5 east to west paths that will have benches from n is . There are n ways to place a bench on the first of these paths. Given the place of the first bench there are n - 1 ways to place a bench on the second of these paths because one of north to south paths is already taken. Given the places of the first and second benches there are n - 2 ways to place a bench on the third of these paths because two of north to south paths are already taken. And the same way n - 3 and n - 4 for the fourth and the fifth benches. Total number of ways to place benches on selected 5 east to west path is n(n - 1)(n - 2)(n - 3)(n - 4). So the formula for the problem is .To avoid 64-bit integer overflow recommended order of computation is exactly as in the formula above, division should not be the last operation.I. Parking LotThere are the following ways to place n cars of the same make. They can be the first n, the last n, or they can be somewhere in the middle of the parking lot.When n cars of the same make are the first or the last, there are 4 ways to choose the make of these n cars, then there are 3 ways to choose the make of one car adjacent to them (the make should be different from the make of n cars) and there are 4 ways to choose the make of each of the remaining n - 3 cars. So the formula for the case of n cars of the same make on either end of the parking lot is 4·3·4n - 3.When n cars of the same make are situated somewhere in the middle, there are 4 ways to choose the make of these n cars, then there are 3 ways to choose the make of each of two cars adjacent to them (the makes of these two cars should be different from the make of n cars) and there are 4 ways to choose the make of each of the remaining n - 4 cars. So the formula for the case of n cars of the same make on a given position somewhere in the middle of the parking lot is 4·32·4n - 4.There are 2 positions of n cars of the same make in the end of the parking lot and there are n - 3 positions of n cars of the same make somewhere in the middle of the parking lot. So the final formula is 2·4·3·4n - 3 + (n - 3)·4·32·4n - 4.J. DivisibilityLet's factorize numbers from 2 to 10. 2 = 2, 3 = 3, 4 = 22, 5 = 5, 6 = 2·3, 7 = 7, 8 = 23, 9 = 32, 10 = 2·5. If a number is divisible by all numbers from 2 to 10, its factorization should contain 2 at least in the power of 3, 3 at least in the power of 2, 5 and 7 at least in the power of 1. So it can be written as x·23·32·5·7 = x·2520. So any number divisible by 2520 is divisible by all numbers from 2 to 10.There are numbers from 1 to n divisible by all numbers from 2 to 10. In a programming language it is usually implemented as simple integer division.K. IndivisibilityThe amount of numbers from 1 to n not divisible by any number from 2 to 10 is equal to the amount of all numbers from 1 to n (that is n) minus the amount of numbers from 1 to n divisible by some number from 2 to 10.The set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by some number from 2 to 10 can be found as union of the set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by 2, the set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by 3 and so on till 10.Note that sets of numbers divisible by 4 or 6 or 8 are subsets of the set of numbers divisible by 2, and sets of numbers divisible by 6 or 9 are subsets of the set of numbers divisible by 3. So there is no need to unite 9 sets, it is enough to unite sets for 2, 3, 5, 7 only.The size of set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by some of 2, 3, 5, 7 can be calculated using inclusion-exclusion principle that says that size of each single set should be added, size of pairwise intersections should be subtracted, size of all intersections of three sets should be added and so on.The size of set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by 2 is equal to , the size of set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by 2 and 3 is equal to and so on.The final formula is Division with rounding down in the formula in a programming language is usually just integer division.L. Cracking the CodeIn this problem just implementation of the actions described in the statement is required. However there are two catches in this problem.The first catch is that the fifth power of five-digit number cannot be represented by a 64-bit integer. But we need not the fifth power, we need the fifth power modulo 105. And mod operation can be applied after each multiplication (see problem A above).The second catch is that you need to output five digits, not the fifth power modulo 105. The difference is when fifth digit from the end is zero. To output a number with the leading zero one can either use corresponding formatting (%05d in printf) or extract digits and output them one by one.M. TurnFirst of all, let's reduce camera rotation angle to [0, 359] degrees range. It is accomplished by the following C++/Java code: angle = (angle % 360 + 360) % 360;Then there are the following cases: [0, 44] degrees — no need to rotate, 45 degrees — 0 or 1 turn to minimum deviation, minimum is 0, [46, 134] degrees — one turn required, 135 degrees — 1 or 2 turns to minimum deviation, minimum is 1, [136, 224] degrees — two turns required, 225 degrees — 2 or 3 turns to minimum deviation, minimum is 2, [226, 314] degrees — three turns required, 315 degrees — 3 or 0 turns to minimum deviation, minimum is 0, [316, 359] degrees — no need to rotate. Let's add 44 degrees to the angle from the range [0, 359]. C++/Java code is angle = (angle + 44) % 360; Then the ranges will be: [0, 89] degrees — 0 turns, [90, 179] degrees — 1 turn, [180, 269] degrees — 2 turns, [270, 358] degrees — 3 turns, 359 degrees — 0 turns. One special case of 359 degrees can be eliminated by taking angle modulo 359. Then just integer division by 90 is required to get the answer. C++/Java code is answer = (angle % 359) / 90;N. ForecastThere is nothing special in solving a quadratic equation but the problem has one catch. You should output the greater root first.The simplest approach is to output max(x1, x2) first, then min(x1, x2).Another approach is based upon the sign of a. for a > 0 and for a < 0.We can divide all coefficients by a, and then the first coefficient will be positive. But notice that division should be done in a floating point type and a should be divided last otherwise resulting a / a = 1 would not be able to divide b and c.O. ArrowTo get a vector of the given length b in the direction of the given vector (vx, vy) it is just required to normalize the given vector (divide it by its length) and then multiply by b.Let's denote , vnx = vx / len, vny = vy / len. Then (vnx, vny) is the normalized vector, and the first point of the arrow is (px + vnx·b, py + vny·b).To get the second point of the arrow one needs to rotate the normalized vector 90 degrees counter-clockwise and then multiply by the half of the triangle base a / 2. Let's denote vlx =  - vny, vly = vnx. Then (vlx, vly) is the normalized vector 90 degrees counter-clockwise to (vnx, vny). So the second point of the arrow is (px + vlx·a / 2, py + vly·a / 2).The third point can be found the same way as the second point but the length of the vector to it is c / 2. So the third point of the arrow is (px + vlx·c / 2, py + vly·c / 2).The fourth point can be found by adding the vector of the length c / 2 to the left of the given and the vector of the length d reverse to the given. So the fourth point of the arrow is (px + vlx·c / 2 - vnx·d, py + vly·c / 2 - vny·d).The remaining points are symmetrical to the points discussed above so they can be obtained the same way, just using minus for (vlx, vly) instead of plus. So the next points are (px - vlx·c / 2 - vnx·d, py - vly·c / 2 - vny·d), (px - vlx·c / 2, py - vly·c / 2), (px - vlx·a / 2, py - vly·a / 2).P. Area of a Star where n in the number of the star corners because in a regular star all angles between corners are equal. because of symmetry. because it is an inscribed angle. because of symmetry.So we know OA = r and and . We can calculate the area of AOB triangle knowing the length of a side and two angles adjacent to it using formula .The whole star area is equal to 2n areas of AOB triangle because of symmetry. .Q. PyramidsThe volume of a pyramid can be calculated as where v is the volume, s is the area of the base and h is the height from the base to the apex. Let's calculate s and h.The area of a regular polygon having n sides of length ln can be found the following way.On the figure above a regular polygon is shown. O is the center of the polygon, all sides are equal to ln, OB is the altitude of AOC triangle. As the polygon is a regular one OA = OC, AOC triangle is a isosceles one and then and AB = BC, also AOB and COB triangles are right-angled ones. Also because the polygon is a regular one and can be seen as a union of 2n triangles equal to AOB triangle then .AOB triangle is right-angled one, so , . Also . So and . The area of AOB is equal to . The area of the polygon is .On the figure above a triangle formed by the pyramid apex H, the center of the base O and some vertex of the base A is shown. It is a right-angled one. As all edges of the pyramid are equal, AH = ln and from calculations above . According to Pythagorean theorem OA2 + OH2 = AH2. So .The volume of one piramid is .And the final formula is .R. GameFor the field of an even size there is a winning strategy for the second player. Namely, to paint a cell that is symmetrical with respect to the center of the field to the cell painted by the first player on the previous turn. After each turn of the second player the field is centrosymmetrical and so there is always a cell that can be painted that is symmetrical with respect to the center of the field to any cell that the first player can choose to paint. .... 1... .1.. .... ....\n.... .... .... 1... .1..\n.... .... .... ...2 ..2.\n.... ...2 ..2. .... ....For the field of an odd size there is a winning strategy for the first player. Namely, on the first turn to paint the central cell, then to paint a cell that is symmetrical with respect to the center of the field to the cell painted by the second player on the previous turn. After each turn of the first player the field is centrosymmetrical and so there is always a cell that can be painted that is symmetrical with respect to the center of the field to any cell that the second player can choose to paint. ..... 2.... .2... ..2.. .....\n..... ..... ..... ..... .2...\n..1.. ..1.. ..1.. ..1.. ..1..\n..... ..... ..... ..... ...1.\n..... ....1 ...1. ..1.. .....So for even n the answer is 2, for odd n the answer is 1. One of the possible formulas for the problem is .n can be up to 1018 so at least 64-bit integer type should be used to input it.",

          "content": "A. Again Twenty Five!The problem of getting the last two digits is equivalent to the problem of getting the number modulo 100. So we need to calculate . According to the rules of modular arithmeticSoLet's note that 52 = 25. ThenAnd so on. All are equal to 25 for all n ≥ 2.So to solve the problem one need to just output 25. There is no need to read n.B. Moore's LawEvery second the number is multiplied by 1.000000011. Multiplication several times to the same number is equivalent to exponentiation. So the formula is n·1.000000011t (1.000000011 raised to the power of t and then multiplied to n). In a program one should not use a loop to calculate power as it is too slow for such big n, usually a programming language provides a function for exponentiation such as pow.C. Lucky NumbersThere are 2 lucky numbers of the length 1. They are 7 and 8. There are 4 lucky numbers of the length 2. They are 77, 78, 87 and 88. There are 8 lucky numbers of the length 3. They are 777, 778, 787, 788, 877, 878, 887, 888. For each addition of 1 to the length the number of lucky numbers is increased times 2. It is easy to prove: to any number of the previous length one can append 7 or 8, so one number of the prevous length creates two numbers of the next length.So for the length n the amount of lucky numbers of the length exactly n is 2n. But in the problem we need the amount of lucky numbers of length not greater than n. Let's sum up them. 21 = 2, 21 + 22 = 2 + 4 = 6, 21 + 22 + 23 = 2 + 4 + 8 = 14, 21 + 22 + 23 + 24 = 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 30. One can notice that the sum of all previous powers of two is equal to the next power of two minus the first power of two. So the answer to the problem is 2n + 1 - 2.One of the possible implementations of 2n + 1 in a programming language is to shift 1 bitwise to the left for n + 1 binary digits or to shift 2 bitwise to the left for n binary digits. For example, in Java the problem answer formula is (2L << n) - 2, in C++ is (2LL << n) - 2. Suffixes L and LL correspondingly are required so that result of the shift expression have 64-bit integer type (long in Java and long long in C++). Type of the second operand does not matter for the type of shift expression, only the type of the first operand. Also parenthesis are required because without them subtraction is performed first and only then bitwise shift.D. Hexagons!Let's count the number of cells having the distance of exactly n. For n = 0 it is 1, for n = 1 it is 6, for n = 2 it is 12, for n = 3 it is 18 and so on. One can notice that n = 0 is a special case, and then the amount increases by addition of 6. These numbers form an arithmetic progression. In the problem we need to sum these numbers. The formula of the sum of an arithmetic progression is (first + last)·amount / 2. The first is 6, the last is 6n, the amount is n. So the sum is (6 + 6n)n / 2 = 3(n + 1)n. And plus 1 that is not in the arithmetic progression. So the final formula is 1 + 3n(n + 1).To avoid overflow, multiplication in the formula should be performed in 64-bit integer type. For this either 3 or 1 or n should have 64-bit integer type. The literals are 64-bit integer when they have suffix L in Java or LL in C++.E. A rectangleLet's see how the number of affected cells changes depending on the column. For example 3, 2, 3, 2, 3. That is it alternates between the size of the first column and the size of the first column minus one. The amount of \"minus ones\" is the amount of columns divided by 2 rounded down. Without \"minus ones\" all columns have equal size and the total amount of cells is equal to size of the first column multiplied by the number of the columns. The first column size is (y2 - y1) / 2 + 1. The columns amount is x2 - x1 + 1. So the final formula is ((y2 - y1) / 2 + 1)·(x2 - x1 + 1) - (x2 - x1) / 2.To avoid overflow, multiplication should be computed in 64-bit integer type.F. Selection of PersonnelThe amount of ways to choose a group of 5 people from n candidates is equal to the number of combinations , the amount of ways to choose a group of 6 people from n candidates is , the amount of ways to choose a group of 7 people from n candidates is , the amount of ways to choose a group of 5, 6 or 7 people from n candidates is .To avoid 64-bit integer overflow can be calculated in the following way: n / 1 * (n - 1) / 2 * (n - 2) / 3 * (n - 3) / 4 * (n - 4) / 5 * (n - 5) / 6 * (n - 6) / 7. Each division returns an integer because each prefix of this formula after division is also the number of combinations .G. Challenge PennantsFirst of all, ways to place both types of the pennants are independent. So each way to place \"I fixed a critical bug\" pennants on n tables is compatible to each way to place \"I suggested a new feature\" pennants on n tables. Therefore the answer of the problem is equal to the number of ways to place \"I fixed a critical bug\" pennants multiplied by the number of ways to place \"I suggested a new feature\" pennant.The number of ways to place k identical items into n different places when any place can contain any amount of items is the definition of the number of k-combinations with repetitions or k-multicombinations. The formula for the number is .So the whole formula for the problem is .To avoid overflow of 64-bit integer type recommended formulas for computation are (n + 2) / 1 * (n + 1) / 2 * n / 3 and (n + 4) / 1 * (n + 3) / 2 * (n + 2) / 3 * (n + 1) / 4 * n / 5.H. BenchesThe number of ways to choose 5 east to west paths that will have benches from n is . There are n ways to place a bench on the first of these paths. Given the place of the first bench there are n - 1 ways to place a bench on the second of these paths because one of north to south paths is already taken. Given the places of the first and second benches there are n - 2 ways to place a bench on the third of these paths because two of north to south paths are already taken. And the same way n - 3 and n - 4 for the fourth and the fifth benches. Total number of ways to place benches on selected 5 east to west path is n(n - 1)(n - 2)(n - 3)(n - 4). So the formula for the problem is .To avoid 64-bit integer overflow recommended order of computation is exactly as in the formula above, division should not be the last operation.I. Parking LotThere are the following ways to place n cars of the same make. They can be the first n, the last n, or they can be somewhere in the middle of the parking lot.When n cars of the same make are the first or the last, there are 4 ways to choose the make of these n cars, then there are 3 ways to choose the make of one car adjacent to them (the make should be different from the make of n cars) and there are 4 ways to choose the make of each of the remaining n - 3 cars. So the formula for the case of n cars of the same make on either end of the parking lot is 4·3·4n - 3.When n cars of the same make are situated somewhere in the middle, there are 4 ways to choose the make of these n cars, then there are 3 ways to choose the make of each of two cars adjacent to them (the makes of these two cars should be different from the make of n cars) and there are 4 ways to choose the make of each of the remaining n - 4 cars. So the formula for the case of n cars of the same make on a given position somewhere in the middle of the parking lot is 4·32·4n - 4.There are 2 positions of n cars of the same make in the end of the parking lot and there are n - 3 positions of n cars of the same make somewhere in the middle of the parking lot. So the final formula is 2·4·3·4n - 3 + (n - 3)·4·32·4n - 4.J. DivisibilityLet's factorize numbers from 2 to 10. 2 = 2, 3 = 3, 4 = 22, 5 = 5, 6 = 2·3, 7 = 7, 8 = 23, 9 = 32, 10 = 2·5. If a number is divisible by all numbers from 2 to 10, its factorization should contain 2 at least in the power of 3, 3 at least in the power of 2, 5 and 7 at least in the power of 1. So it can be written as x·23·32·5·7 = x·2520. So any number divisible by 2520 is divisible by all numbers from 2 to 10.There are numbers from 1 to n divisible by all numbers from 2 to 10. In a programming language it is usually implemented as simple integer division.K. IndivisibilityThe amount of numbers from 1 to n not divisible by any number from 2 to 10 is equal to the amount of all numbers from 1 to n (that is n) minus the amount of numbers from 1 to n divisible by some number from 2 to 10.The set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by some number from 2 to 10 can be found as union of the set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by 2, the set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by 3 and so on till 10.Note that sets of numbers divisible by 4 or 6 or 8 are subsets of the set of numbers divisible by 2, and sets of numbers divisible by 6 or 9 are subsets of the set of numbers divisible by 3. So there is no need to unite 9 sets, it is enough to unite sets for 2, 3, 5, 7 only.The size of set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by some of 2, 3, 5, 7 can be calculated using inclusion-exclusion principle that says that size of each single set should be added, size of pairwise intersections should be subtracted, size of all intersections of three sets should be added and so on.The size of set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by 2 is equal to , the size of set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by 2 and 3 is equal to and so on.The final formula is Division with rounding down in the formula in a programming language is usually just integer division.L. Cracking the CodeIn this problem just implementation of the actions described in the statement is required. However there are two catches in this problem.The first catch is that the fifth power of five-digit number cannot be represented by a 64-bit integer. But we need not the fifth power, we need the fifth power modulo 105. And mod operation can be applied after each multiplication (see problem A above).The second catch is that you need to output five digits, not the fifth power modulo 105. The difference is when fifth digit from the end is zero. To output a number with the leading zero one can either use corresponding formatting (%05d in printf) or extract digits and output them one by one.M. TurnFirst of all, let's reduce camera rotation angle to [0, 359] degrees range. It is accomplished by the following C++/Java code: angle = (angle % 360 + 360) % 360;Then there are the following cases: [0, 44] degrees — no need to rotate, 45 degrees — 0 or 1 turn to minimum deviation, minimum is 0, [46, 134] degrees — one turn required, 135 degrees — 1 or 2 turns to minimum deviation, minimum is 1, [136, 224] degrees — two turns required, 225 degrees — 2 or 3 turns to minimum deviation, minimum is 2, [226, 314] degrees — three turns required, 315 degrees — 3 or 0 turns to minimum deviation, minimum is 0, [316, 359] degrees — no need to rotate. Let's add 44 degrees to the angle from the range [0, 359]. C++/Java code is angle = (angle + 44) % 360; Then the ranges will be: [0, 89] degrees — 0 turns, [90, 179] degrees — 1 turn, [180, 269] degrees — 2 turns, [270, 358] degrees — 3 turns, 359 degrees — 0 turns. One special case of 359 degrees can be eliminated by taking angle modulo 359. Then just integer division by 90 is required to get the answer. C++/Java code is answer = (angle % 359) / 90;N. ForecastThere is nothing special in solving a quadratic equation but the problem has one catch. You should output the greater root first.The simplest approach is to output max(x1, x2) first, then min(x1, x2).Another approach is based upon the sign of a. for a > 0 and for a < 0.We can divide all coefficients by a, and then the first coefficient will be positive. But notice that division should be done in a floating point type and a should be divided last otherwise resulting a / a = 1 would not be able to divide b and c.O. ArrowTo get a vector of the given length b in the direction of the given vector (vx, vy) it is just required to normalize the given vector (divide it by its length) and then multiply by b.Let's denote , vnx = vx / len, vny = vy / len. Then (vnx, vny) is the normalized vector, and the first point of the arrow is (px + vnx·b, py + vny·b).To get the second point of the arrow one needs to rotate the normalized vector 90 degrees counter-clockwise and then multiply by the half of the triangle base a / 2. Let's denote vlx =  - vny, vly = vnx. Then (vlx, vly) is the normalized vector 90 degrees counter-clockwise to (vnx, vny). So the second point of the arrow is (px + vlx·a / 2, py + vly·a / 2).The third point can be found the same way as the second point but the length of the vector to it is c / 2. So the third point of the arrow is (px + vlx·c / 2, py + vly·c / 2).The fourth point can be found by adding the vector of the length c / 2 to the left of the given and the vector of the length d reverse to the given. So the fourth point of the arrow is (px + vlx·c / 2 - vnx·d, py + vly·c / 2 - vny·d).The remaining points are symmetrical to the points discussed above so they can be obtained the same way, just using minus for (vlx, vly) instead of plus. So the next points are (px - vlx·c / 2 - vnx·d, py - vly·c / 2 - vny·d), (px - vlx·c / 2, py - vly·c / 2), (px - vlx·a / 2, py - vly·a / 2).P. Area of a Star where n in the number of the star corners because in a regular star all angles between corners are equal. because of symmetry. because it is an inscribed angle. because of symmetry.So we know OA = r and and . We can calculate the area of AOB triangle knowing the length of a side and two angles adjacent to it using formula .The whole star area is equal to 2n areas of AOB triangle because of symmetry. .Q. PyramidsThe volume of a pyramid can be calculated as where v is the volume, s is the area of the base and h is the height from the base to the apex. Let's calculate s and h.The area of a regular polygon having n sides of length ln can be found the following way.On the figure above a regular polygon is shown. O is the center of the polygon, all sides are equal to ln, OB is the altitude of AOC triangle. As the polygon is a regular one OA = OC, AOC triangle is a isosceles one and then and AB = BC, also AOB and COB triangles are right-angled ones. Also because the polygon is a regular one and can be seen as a union of 2n triangles equal to AOB triangle then .AOB triangle is right-angled one, so , . Also . So and . The area of AOB is equal to . The area of the polygon is .On the figure above a triangle formed by the pyramid apex H, the center of the base O and some vertex of the base A is shown. It is a right-angled one. As all edges of the pyramid are equal, AH = ln and from calculations above . According to Pythagorean theorem OA2 + OH2 = AH2. So .The volume of one piramid is .And the final formula is .R. GameFor the field of an even size there is a winning strategy for the second player. Namely, to paint a cell that is symmetrical with respect to the center of the field to the cell painted by the first player on the previous turn. After each turn of the second player the field is centrosymmetrical and so there is always a cell that can be painted that is symmetrical with respect to the center of the field to any cell that the first player can choose to paint. .... 1... .1.. .... ....\n.... .... .... 1... .1..\n.... .... .... ...2 ..2.\n.... ...2 ..2. .... ....For the field of an odd size there is a winning strategy for the first player. Namely, on the first turn to paint the central cell, then to paint a cell that is symmetrical with respect to the center of the field to the cell painted by the second player on the previous turn. After each turn of the first player the field is centrosymmetrical and so there is always a cell that can be painted that is symmetrical with respect to the center of the field to any cell that the second player can choose to paint. ..... 2.... .2... ..2.. .....\n..... ..... ..... ..... .2...\n..1.. ..1.. ..1.. ..1.. ..1..\n..... ..... ..... ..... ...1.\n..... ....1 ...1. ..1.. .....So for even n the answer is 2, for odd n the answer is 1. One of the possible formulas for the problem is .n can be up to 1018 so at least 64-bit integer type should be used to input it.",

          "content": "A. Again Twenty Five!The problem of getting the last two digits is equivalent to the problem of getting the number modulo 100. So we need to calculate . According to the rules of modular arithmeticSoLet's note that 52 = 25. ThenAnd so on. All are equal to 25 for all n ≥ 2.So to solve the problem one need to just output 25. There is no need to read n.B. Moore's LawEvery second the number is multiplied by 1.000000011. Multiplication several times to the same number is equivalent to exponentiation. So the formula is n·1.000000011t (1.000000011 raised to the power of t and then multiplied to n). In a program one should not use a loop to calculate power as it is too slow for such big n, usually a programming language provides a function for exponentiation such as pow.C. Lucky NumbersThere are 2 lucky numbers of the length 1. They are 7 and 8. There are 4 lucky numbers of the length 2. They are 77, 78, 87 and 88. There are 8 lucky numbers of the length 3. They are 777, 778, 787, 788, 877, 878, 887, 888. For each addition of 1 to the length the number of lucky numbers is increased times 2. It is easy to prove: to any number of the previous length one can append 7 or 8, so one number of the prevous length creates two numbers of the next length.So for the length n the amount of lucky numbers of the length exactly n is 2n. But in the problem we need the amount of lucky numbers of length not greater than n. Let's sum up them. 21 = 2, 21 + 22 = 2 + 4 = 6, 21 + 22 + 23 = 2 + 4 + 8 = 14, 21 + 22 + 23 + 24 = 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 30. One can notice that the sum of all previous powers of two is equal to the next power of two minus the first power of two. So the answer to the problem is 2n + 1 - 2.One of the possible implementations of 2n + 1 in a programming language is to shift 1 bitwise to the left for n + 1 binary digits or to shift 2 bitwise to the left for n binary digits. For example, in Java the problem answer formula is (2L << n) - 2, in C++ is (2LL << n) - 2. Suffixes L and LL correspondingly are required so that result of the shift expression have 64-bit integer type (long in Java and long long in C++). Type of the second operand does not matter for the type of shift expression, only the type of the first operand. Also parenthesis are required because without them subtraction is performed first and only then bitwise shift.D. Hexagons!Let's count the number of cells having the distance of exactly n. For n = 0 it is 1, for n = 1 it is 6, for n = 2 it is 12, for n = 3 it is 18 and so on. One can notice that n = 0 is a special case, and then the amount increases by addition of 6. These numbers form an arithmetic progression. In the problem we need to sum these numbers. The formula of the sum of an arithmetic progression is (first + last)·amount / 2. The first is 6, the last is 6n, the amount is n. So the sum is (6 + 6n)n / 2 = 3(n + 1)n. And plus 1 that is not in the arithmetic progression. So the final formula is 1 + 3n(n + 1).To avoid overflow, multiplication in the formula should be performed in 64-bit integer type. For this either 3 or 1 or n should have 64-bit integer type. The literals are 64-bit integer when they have suffix L in Java or LL in C++.E. A rectangleLet's see how the number of affected cells changes depending on the column. For example 3, 2, 3, 2, 3. That is it alternates between the size of the first column and the size of the first column minus one. The amount of \"minus ones\" is the amount of columns divided by 2 rounded down. Without \"minus ones\" all columns have equal size and the total amount of cells is equal to size of the first column multiplied by the number of the columns. The first column size is (y2 - y1) / 2 + 1. The columns amount is x2 - x1 + 1. So the final formula is ((y2 - y1) / 2 + 1)·(x2 - x1 + 1) - (x2 - x1) / 2.To avoid overflow, multiplication should be computed in 64-bit integer type.F. Selection of PersonnelThe amount of ways to choose a group of 5 people from n candidates is equal to the number of combinations , the amount of ways to choose a group of 6 people from n candidates is , the amount of ways to choose a group of 7 people from n candidates is , the amount of ways to choose a group of 5, 6 or 7 people from n candidates is .To avoid 64-bit integer overflow can be calculated in the following way: n / 1 * (n - 1) / 2 * (n - 2) / 3 * (n - 3) / 4 * (n - 4) / 5 * (n - 5) / 6 * (n - 6) / 7. Each division returns an integer because each prefix of this formula after division is also the number of combinations .G. Challenge PennantsFirst of all, ways to place both types of the pennants are independent. So each way to place \"I fixed a critical bug\" pennants on n tables is compatible to each way to place \"I suggested a new feature\" pennants on n tables. Therefore the answer of the problem is equal to the number of ways to place \"I fixed a critical bug\" pennants multiplied by the number of ways to place \"I suggested a new feature\" pennant.The number of ways to place k identical items into n different places when any place can contain any amount of items is the definition of the number of k-combinations with repetitions or k-multicombinations. The formula for the number is .So the whole formula for the problem is .To avoid overflow of 64-bit integer type recommended formulas for computation are (n + 2) / 1 * (n + 1) / 2 * n / 3 and (n + 4) / 1 * (n + 3) / 2 * (n + 2) / 3 * (n + 1) / 4 * n / 5.H. BenchesThe number of ways to choose 5 east to west paths that will have benches from n is . There are n ways to place a bench on the first of these paths. Given the place of the first bench there are n - 1 ways to place a bench on the second of these paths because one of north to south paths is already taken. Given the places of the first and second benches there are n - 2 ways to place a bench on the third of these paths because two of north to south paths are already taken. And the same way n - 3 and n - 4 for the fourth and the fifth benches. Total number of ways to place benches on selected 5 east to west path is n(n - 1)(n - 2)(n - 3)(n - 4). So the formula for the problem is .To avoid 64-bit integer overflow recommended order of computation is exactly as in the formula above, division should not be the last operation.I. Parking LotThere are the following ways to place n cars of the same make. They can be the first n, the last n, or they can be somewhere in the middle of the parking lot.When n cars of the same make are the first or the last, there are 4 ways to choose the make of these n cars, then there are 3 ways to choose the make of one car adjacent to them (the make should be different from the make of n cars) and there are 4 ways to choose the make of each of the remaining n - 3 cars. So the formula for the case of n cars of the same make on either end of the parking lot is 4·3·4n - 3.When n cars of the same make are situated somewhere in the middle, there are 4 ways to choose the make of these n cars, then there are 3 ways to choose the make of each of two cars adjacent to them (the makes of these two cars should be different from the make of n cars) and there are 4 ways to choose the make of each of the remaining n - 4 cars. So the formula for the case of n cars of the same make on a given position somewhere in the middle of the parking lot is 4·32·4n - 4.There are 2 positions of n cars of the same make in the end of the parking lot and there are n - 3 positions of n cars of the same make somewhere in the middle of the parking lot. So the final formula is 2·4·3·4n - 3 + (n - 3)·4·32·4n - 4.J. DivisibilityLet's factorize numbers from 2 to 10. 2 = 2, 3 = 3, 4 = 22, 5 = 5, 6 = 2·3, 7 = 7, 8 = 23, 9 = 32, 10 = 2·5. If a number is divisible by all numbers from 2 to 10, its factorization should contain 2 at least in the power of 3, 3 at least in the power of 2, 5 and 7 at least in the power of 1. So it can be written as x·23·32·5·7 = x·2520. So any number divisible by 2520 is divisible by all numbers from 2 to 10.There are numbers from 1 to n divisible by all numbers from 2 to 10. In a programming language it is usually implemented as simple integer division.K. IndivisibilityThe amount of numbers from 1 to n not divisible by any number from 2 to 10 is equal to the amount of all numbers from 1 to n (that is n) minus the amount of numbers from 1 to n divisible by some number from 2 to 10.The set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by some number from 2 to 10 can be found as union of the set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by 2, the set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by 3 and so on till 10.Note that sets of numbers divisible by 4 or 6 or 8 are subsets of the set of numbers divisible by 2, and sets of numbers divisible by 6 or 9 are subsets of the set of numbers divisible by 3. So there is no need to unite 9 sets, it is enough to unite sets for 2, 3, 5, 7 only.The size of set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by some of 2, 3, 5, 7 can be calculated using inclusion-exclusion principle that says that size of each single set should be added, size of pairwise intersections should be subtracted, size of all intersections of three sets should be added and so on.The size of set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by 2 is equal to , the size of set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by 2 and 3 is equal to and so on.The final formula is Division with rounding down in the formula in a programming language is usually just integer division.L. Cracking the CodeIn this problem just implementation of the actions described in the statement is required. However there are two catches in this problem.The first catch is that the fifth power of five-digit number cannot be represented by a 64-bit integer. But we need not the fifth power, we need the fifth power modulo 105. And mod operation can be applied after each multiplication (see problem A above).The second catch is that you need to output five digits, not the fifth power modulo 105. The difference is when fifth digit from the end is zero. To output a number with the leading zero one can either use corresponding formatting (%05d in printf) or extract digits and output them one by one.M. TurnFirst of all, let's reduce camera rotation angle to [0, 359] degrees range. It is accomplished by the following C++/Java code: angle = (angle % 360 + 360) % 360;Then there are the following cases: [0, 44] degrees — no need to rotate, 45 degrees — 0 or 1 turn to minimum deviation, minimum is 0, [46, 134] degrees — one turn required, 135 degrees — 1 or 2 turns to minimum deviation, minimum is 1, [136, 224] degrees — two turns required, 225 degrees — 2 or 3 turns to minimum deviation, minimum is 2, [226, 314] degrees — three turns required, 315 degrees — 3 or 0 turns to minimum deviation, minimum is 0, [316, 359] degrees — no need to rotate. Let's add 44 degrees to the angle from the range [0, 359]. C++/Java code is angle = (angle + 44) % 360; Then the ranges will be: [0, 89] degrees — 0 turns, [90, 179] degrees — 1 turn, [180, 269] degrees — 2 turns, [270, 358] degrees — 3 turns, 359 degrees — 0 turns. One special case of 359 degrees can be eliminated by taking angle modulo 359. Then just integer division by 90 is required to get the answer. C++/Java code is answer = (angle % 359) / 90;N. ForecastThere is nothing special in solving a quadratic equation but the problem has one catch. You should output the greater root first.The simplest approach is to output max(x1, x2) first, then min(x1, x2).Another approach is based upon the sign of a. for a > 0 and for a < 0.We can divide all coefficients by a, and then the first coefficient will be positive. But notice that division should be done in a floating point type and a should be divided last otherwise resulting a / a = 1 would not be able to divide b and c.O. ArrowTo get a vector of the given length b in the direction of the given vector (vx, vy) it is just required to normalize the given vector (divide it by its length) and then multiply by b.Let's denote , vnx = vx / len, vny = vy / len. Then (vnx, vny) is the normalized vector, and the first point of the arrow is (px + vnx·b, py + vny·b).To get the second point of the arrow one needs to rotate the normalized vector 90 degrees counter-clockwise and then multiply by the half of the triangle base a / 2. Let's denote vlx =  - vny, vly = vnx. Then (vlx, vly) is the normalized vector 90 degrees counter-clockwise to (vnx, vny). So the second point of the arrow is (px + vlx·a / 2, py + vly·a / 2).The third point can be found the same way as the second point but the length of the vector to it is c / 2. So the third point of the arrow is (px + vlx·c / 2, py + vly·c / 2).The fourth point can be found by adding the vector of the length c / 2 to the left of the given and the vector of the length d reverse to the given. So the fourth point of the arrow is (px + vlx·c / 2 - vnx·d, py + vly·c / 2 - vny·d).The remaining points are symmetrical to the points discussed above so they can be obtained the same way, just using minus for (vlx, vly) instead of plus. So the next points are (px - vlx·c / 2 - vnx·d, py - vly·c / 2 - vny·d), (px - vlx·c / 2, py - vly·c / 2), (px - vlx·a / 2, py - vly·a / 2).P. Area of a Star where n in the number of the star corners because in a regular star all angles between corners are equal. because of symmetry. because it is an inscribed angle. because of symmetry.So we know OA = r and and . We can calculate the area of AOB triangle knowing the length of a side and two angles adjacent to it using formula .The whole star area is equal to 2n areas of AOB triangle because of symmetry. .Q. PyramidsThe volume of a pyramid can be calculated as where v is the volume, s is the area of the base and h is the height from the base to the apex. Let's calculate s and h.The area of a regular polygon having n sides of length ln can be found the following way.On the figure above a regular polygon is shown. O is the center of the polygon, all sides are equal to ln, OB is the altitude of AOC triangle. As the polygon is a regular one OA = OC, AOC triangle is a isosceles one and then and AB = BC, also AOB and COB triangles are right-angled ones. Also because the polygon is a regular one and can be seen as a union of 2n triangles equal to AOB triangle then .AOB triangle is right-angled one, so , . Also . So and . The area of AOB is equal to . The area of the polygon is .On the figure above a triangle formed by the pyramid apex H, the center of the base O and some vertex of the base A is shown. It is a right-angled one. As all edges of the pyramid are equal, AH = ln and from calculations above . According to Pythagorean theorem OA2 + OH2 = AH2. So .The volume of one piramid is .And the final formula is .R. GameFor the field of an even size there is a winning strategy for the second player. Namely, to paint a cell that is symmetrical with respect to the center of the field to the cell painted by the first player on the previous turn. After each turn of the second player the field is centrosymmetrical and so there is always a cell that can be painted that is symmetrical with respect to the center of the field to any cell that the first player can choose to paint. .... 1... .1.. .... ....\n.... .... .... 1... .1..\n.... .... .... ...2 ..2.\n.... ...2 ..2. .... ....For the field of an odd size there is a winning strategy for the first player. Namely, on the first turn to paint the central cell, then to paint a cell that is symmetrical with respect to the center of the field to the cell painted by the second player on the previous turn. After each turn of the first player the field is centrosymmetrical and so there is always a cell that can be painted that is symmetrical with respect to the center of the field to any cell that the second player can choose to paint. ..... 2.... .2... ..2.. .....\n..... ..... ..... ..... .2...\n..1.. ..1.. ..1.. ..1.. ..1..\n..... ..... ..... ..... ...1.\n..... ....1 ...1. ..1.. .....So for even n the answer is 2, for odd n the answer is 1. One of the possible formulas for the problem is .n can be up to 1018 so at least 64-bit integer type should be used to input it.",

          "content": "A. Again Twenty Five!The problem of getting the last two digits is equivalent to the problem of getting the number modulo 100. So we need to calculate . According to the rules of modular arithmeticSoLet's note that 52 = 25. ThenAnd so on. All are equal to 25 for all n ≥ 2.So to solve the problem one need to just output 25. There is no need to read n.B. Moore's LawEvery second the number is multiplied by 1.000000011. Multiplication several times to the same number is equivalent to exponentiation. So the formula is n·1.000000011t (1.000000011 raised to the power of t and then multiplied to n). In a program one should not use a loop to calculate power as it is too slow for such big n, usually a programming language provides a function for exponentiation such as pow.C. Lucky NumbersThere are 2 lucky numbers of the length 1. They are 7 and 8. There are 4 lucky numbers of the length 2. They are 77, 78, 87 and 88. There are 8 lucky numbers of the length 3. They are 777, 778, 787, 788, 877, 878, 887, 888. For each addition of 1 to the length the number of lucky numbers is increased times 2. It is easy to prove: to any number of the previous length one can append 7 or 8, so one number of the prevous length creates two numbers of the next length.So for the length n the amount of lucky numbers of the length exactly n is 2n. But in the problem we need the amount of lucky numbers of length not greater than n. Let's sum up them. 21 = 2, 21 + 22 = 2 + 4 = 6, 21 + 22 + 23 = 2 + 4 + 8 = 14, 21 + 22 + 23 + 24 = 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 30. One can notice that the sum of all previous powers of two is equal to the next power of two minus the first power of two. So the answer to the problem is 2n + 1 - 2.One of the possible implementations of 2n + 1 in a programming language is to shift 1 bitwise to the left for n + 1 binary digits or to shift 2 bitwise to the left for n binary digits. For example, in Java the problem answer formula is (2L << n) - 2, in C++ is (2LL << n) - 2. Suffixes L and LL correspondingly are required so that result of the shift expression have 64-bit integer type (long in Java and long long in C++). Type of the second operand does not matter for the type of shift expression, only the type of the first operand. Also parenthesis are required because without them subtraction is performed first and only then bitwise shift.D. Hexagons!Let's count the number of cells having the distance of exactly n. For n = 0 it is 1, for n = 1 it is 6, for n = 2 it is 12, for n = 3 it is 18 and so on. One can notice that n = 0 is a special case, and then the amount increases by addition of 6. These numbers form an arithmetic progression. In the problem we need to sum these numbers. The formula of the sum of an arithmetic progression is (first + last)·amount / 2. The first is 6, the last is 6n, the amount is n. So the sum is (6 + 6n)n / 2 = 3(n + 1)n. And plus 1 that is not in the arithmetic progression. So the final formula is 1 + 3n(n + 1).To avoid overflow, multiplication in the formula should be performed in 64-bit integer type. For this either 3 or 1 or n should have 64-bit integer type. The literals are 64-bit integer when they have suffix L in Java or LL in C++.E. A rectangleLet's see how the number of affected cells changes depending on the column. For example 3, 2, 3, 2, 3. That is it alternates between the size of the first column and the size of the first column minus one. The amount of \"minus ones\" is the amount of columns divided by 2 rounded down. Without \"minus ones\" all columns have equal size and the total amount of cells is equal to size of the first column multiplied by the number of the columns. The first column size is (y2 - y1) / 2 + 1. The columns amount is x2 - x1 + 1. So the final formula is ((y2 - y1) / 2 + 1)·(x2 - x1 + 1) - (x2 - x1) / 2.To avoid overflow, multiplication should be computed in 64-bit integer type.F. Selection of PersonnelThe amount of ways to choose a group of 5 people from n candidates is equal to the number of combinations , the amount of ways to choose a group of 6 people from n candidates is , the amount of ways to choose a group of 7 people from n candidates is , the amount of ways to choose a group of 5, 6 or 7 people from n candidates is .To avoid 64-bit integer overflow can be calculated in the following way: n / 1 * (n - 1) / 2 * (n - 2) / 3 * (n - 3) / 4 * (n - 4) / 5 * (n - 5) / 6 * (n - 6) / 7. Each division returns an integer because each prefix of this formula after division is also the number of combinations .G. Challenge PennantsFirst of all, ways to place both types of the pennants are independent. So each way to place \"I fixed a critical bug\" pennants on n tables is compatible to each way to place \"I suggested a new feature\" pennants on n tables. Therefore the answer of the problem is equal to the number of ways to place \"I fixed a critical bug\" pennants multiplied by the number of ways to place \"I suggested a new feature\" pennant.The number of ways to place k identical items into n different places when any place can contain any amount of items is the definition of the number of k-combinations with repetitions or k-multicombinations. The formula for the number is .So the whole formula for the problem is .To avoid overflow of 64-bit integer type recommended formulas for computation are (n + 2) / 1 * (n + 1) / 2 * n / 3 and (n + 4) / 1 * (n + 3) / 2 * (n + 2) / 3 * (n + 1) / 4 * n / 5.H. BenchesThe number of ways to choose 5 east to west paths that will have benches from n is . There are n ways to place a bench on the first of these paths. Given the place of the first bench there are n - 1 ways to place a bench on the second of these paths because one of north to south paths is already taken. Given the places of the first and second benches there are n - 2 ways to place a bench on the third of these paths because two of north to south paths are already taken. And the same way n - 3 and n - 4 for the fourth and the fifth benches. Total number of ways to place benches on selected 5 east to west path is n(n - 1)(n - 2)(n - 3)(n - 4). So the formula for the problem is .To avoid 64-bit integer overflow recommended order of computation is exactly as in the formula above, division should not be the last operation.I. Parking LotThere are the following ways to place n cars of the same make. They can be the first n, the last n, or they can be somewhere in the middle of the parking lot.When n cars of the same make are the first or the last, there are 4 ways to choose the make of these n cars, then there are 3 ways to choose the make of one car adjacent to them (the make should be different from the make of n cars) and there are 4 ways to choose the make of each of the remaining n - 3 cars. So the formula for the case of n cars of the same make on either end of the parking lot is 4·3·4n - 3.When n cars of the same make are situated somewhere in the middle, there are 4 ways to choose the make of these n cars, then there are 3 ways to choose the make of each of two cars adjacent to them (the makes of these two cars should be different from the make of n cars) and there are 4 ways to choose the make of each of the remaining n - 4 cars. So the formula for the case of n cars of the same make on a given position somewhere in the middle of the parking lot is 4·32·4n - 4.There are 2 positions of n cars of the same make in the end of the parking lot and there are n - 3 positions of n cars of the same make somewhere in the middle of the parking lot. So the final formula is 2·4·3·4n - 3 + (n - 3)·4·32·4n - 4.J. DivisibilityLet's factorize numbers from 2 to 10. 2 = 2, 3 = 3, 4 = 22, 5 = 5, 6 = 2·3, 7 = 7, 8 = 23, 9 = 32, 10 = 2·5. If a number is divisible by all numbers from 2 to 10, its factorization should contain 2 at least in the power of 3, 3 at least in the power of 2, 5 and 7 at least in the power of 1. So it can be written as x·23·32·5·7 = x·2520. So any number divisible by 2520 is divisible by all numbers from 2 to 10.There are numbers from 1 to n divisible by all numbers from 2 to 10. In a programming language it is usually implemented as simple integer division.K. IndivisibilityThe amount of numbers from 1 to n not divisible by any number from 2 to 10 is equal to the amount of all numbers from 1 to n (that is n) minus the amount of numbers from 1 to n divisible by some number from 2 to 10.The set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by some number from 2 to 10 can be found as union of the set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by 2, the set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by 3 and so on till 10.Note that sets of numbers divisible by 4 or 6 or 8 are subsets of the set of numbers divisible by 2, and sets of numbers divisible by 6 or 9 are subsets of the set of numbers divisible by 3. So there is no need to unite 9 sets, it is enough to unite sets for 2, 3, 5, 7 only.The size of set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by some of 2, 3, 5, 7 can be calculated using inclusion-exclusion principle that says that size of each single set should be added, size of pairwise intersections should be subtracted, size of all intersections of three sets should be added and so on.The size of set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by 2 is equal to , the size of set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by 2 and 3 is equal to and so on.The final formula is Division with rounding down in the formula in a programming language is usually just integer division.L. Cracking the CodeIn this problem just implementation of the actions described in the statement is required. However there are two catches in this problem.The first catch is that the fifth power of five-digit number cannot be represented by a 64-bit integer. But we need not the fifth power, we need the fifth power modulo 105. And mod operation can be applied after each multiplication (see problem A above).The second catch is that you need to output five digits, not the fifth power modulo 105. The difference is when fifth digit from the end is zero. To output a number with the leading zero one can either use corresponding formatting (%05d in printf) or extract digits and output them one by one.M. TurnFirst of all, let's reduce camera rotation angle to [0, 359] degrees range. It is accomplished by the following C++/Java code: angle = (angle % 360 + 360) % 360;Then there are the following cases: [0, 44] degrees — no need to rotate, 45 degrees — 0 or 1 turn to minimum deviation, minimum is 0, [46, 134] degrees — one turn required, 135 degrees — 1 or 2 turns to minimum deviation, minimum is 1, [136, 224] degrees — two turns required, 225 degrees — 2 or 3 turns to minimum deviation, minimum is 2, [226, 314] degrees — three turns required, 315 degrees — 3 or 0 turns to minimum deviation, minimum is 0, [316, 359] degrees — no need to rotate. Let's add 44 degrees to the angle from the range [0, 359]. C++/Java code is angle = (angle + 44) % 360; Then the ranges will be: [0, 89] degrees — 0 turns, [90, 179] degrees — 1 turn, [180, 269] degrees — 2 turns, [270, 358] degrees — 3 turns, 359 degrees — 0 turns. One special case of 359 degrees can be eliminated by taking angle modulo 359. Then just integer division by 90 is required to get the answer. C++/Java code is answer = (angle % 359) / 90;N. ForecastThere is nothing special in solving a quadratic equation but the problem has one catch. You should output the greater root first.The simplest approach is to output max(x1, x2) first, then min(x1, x2).Another approach is based upon the sign of a. for a > 0 and for a < 0.We can divide all coefficients by a, and then the first coefficient will be positive. But notice that division should be done in a floating point type and a should be divided last otherwise resulting a / a = 1 would not be able to divide b and c.O. ArrowTo get a vector of the given length b in the direction of the given vector (vx, vy) it is just required to normalize the given vector (divide it by its length) and then multiply by b.Let's denote , vnx = vx / len, vny = vy / len. Then (vnx, vny) is the normalized vector, and the first point of the arrow is (px + vnx·b, py + vny·b).To get the second point of the arrow one needs to rotate the normalized vector 90 degrees counter-clockwise and then multiply by the half of the triangle base a / 2. Let's denote vlx =  - vny, vly = vnx. Then (vlx, vly) is the normalized vector 90 degrees counter-clockwise to (vnx, vny). So the second point of the arrow is (px + vlx·a / 2, py + vly·a / 2).The third point can be found the same way as the second point but the length of the vector to it is c / 2. So the third point of the arrow is (px + vlx·c / 2, py + vly·c / 2).The fourth point can be found by adding the vector of the length c / 2 to the left of the given and the vector of the length d reverse to the given. So the fourth point of the arrow is (px + vlx·c / 2 - vnx·d, py + vly·c / 2 - vny·d).The remaining points are symmetrical to the points discussed above so they can be obtained the same way, just using minus for (vlx, vly) instead of plus. So the next points are (px - vlx·c / 2 - vnx·d, py - vly·c / 2 - vny·d), (px - vlx·c / 2, py - vly·c / 2), (px - vlx·a / 2, py - vly·a / 2).P. Area of a Star where n in the number of the star corners because in a regular star all angles between corners are equal. because of symmetry. because it is an inscribed angle. because of symmetry.So we know OA = r and and . We can calculate the area of AOB triangle knowing the length of a side and two angles adjacent to it using formula .The whole star area is equal to 2n areas of AOB triangle because of symmetry. .Q. PyramidsThe volume of a pyramid can be calculated as where v is the volume, s is the area of the base and h is the height from the base to the apex. Let's calculate s and h.The area of a regular polygon having n sides of length ln can be found the following way.On the figure above a regular polygon is shown. O is the center of the polygon, all sides are equal to ln, OB is the altitude of AOC triangle. As the polygon is a regular one OA = OC, AOC triangle is a isosceles one and then and AB = BC, also AOB and COB triangles are right-angled ones. Also because the polygon is a regular one and can be seen as a union of 2n triangles equal to AOB triangle then .AOB triangle is right-angled one, so , . Also . So and . The area of AOB is equal to . The area of the polygon is .On the figure above a triangle formed by the pyramid apex H, the center of the base O and some vertex of the base A is shown. It is a right-angled one. As all edges of the pyramid are equal, AH = ln and from calculations above . According to Pythagorean theorem OA2 + OH2 = AH2. So .The volume of one piramid is .And the final formula is .R. GameFor the field of an even size there is a winning strategy for the second player. Namely, to paint a cell that is symmetrical with respect to the center of the field to the cell painted by the first player on the previous turn. After each turn of the second player the field is centrosymmetrical and so there is always a cell that can be painted that is symmetrical with respect to the center of the field to any cell that the first player can choose to paint. .... 1... .1.. .... ....\n.... .... .... 1... .1..\n.... .... .... ...2 ..2.\n.... ...2 ..2. .... ....For the field of an odd size there is a winning strategy for the first player. Namely, on the first turn to paint the central cell, then to paint a cell that is symmetrical with respect to the center of the field to the cell painted by the second player on the previous turn. After each turn of the first player the field is centrosymmetrical and so there is always a cell that can be painted that is symmetrical with respect to the center of the field to any cell that the second player can choose to paint. ..... 2.... .2... ..2.. .....\n..... ..... ..... ..... .2...\n..1.. ..1.. ..1.. ..1.. ..1..\n..... ..... ..... ..... ...1.\n..... ....1 ...1. ..1.. .....So for even n the answer is 2, for odd n the answer is 1. One of the possible formulas for the problem is .n can be up to 1018 so at least 64-bit integer type should be used to input it.",

На этот раз набор задач рекомендован для участников из Div.2.Раунд будет нерейтинговым для всех участников. Соревнование будет проводиться согласно стандартным правилам ACM ICPC. У Вас будет 180 минут (три часа), чтобы решить 18 задач. После раунда не будет фазы взломов.Наша основная целевая аудитория — начинающие и члены Div. 2. Все предложенные задачи могут быть решены без условий и циклов. Требуются только формулы. Присваивания и функции могут быть использованы для сокращения дублирования кода.Темы задач: комбинаторика геометрия теория игр последовательности другое Раунд подготовлен как часть комплекса мероприятий Вологодский БИТ, также как часть этих мероприятий проходили вебинары «Олимпиадное программирование с нуля на Java», посвящённые перечисленным выше темам. Записи вебинаров доступны на YouTube (на русском).Раунд был подготовлен мной, Фёдором Меньшиковым mfv, Игорем Андриановым igand и Олегом Стрекаловским OSt. Особая благодарность Марии Беловой Delinur за вычитку и исправление условий на английском и конечно Михаилу Мирзаянову MikeMirzayanov за платформу Codeforces и Полигон. Полигон сделал чекеры и тесты для этого соревнования лучше.UPD: Разбор задач завершён.",

This time the problemset is recommended for Div.2 participants.The round will be unrated for all users and it will be held according to the standard ACM-ICPC rules. You will have 180 minutes (three hours) to solve 18 problems. There will be no open hacks phase after the round.Our main target audience is beginners and Div. 2 members. All offered problems can be solved without conditional constructs and without loops. Only formulas are required. Assignments and functions can be used to reduce code duplication.The topics of the problems are: combinatorics geometry game theory sequences other The round is created as a part of Vologda BIT event, also as part of this event “Contest programming from zero in Java” webinars were held devoted to the topics listed above. Recordings of the webinars are available on YouTube (in Russian).The round was prepared by me, Fyodor Menshikov mfv, Igor Andrianov igand and Oleg Strekalovsky OSt. Special thanks to Maria Belova Delinur for bugfixing the English statements and of course to MikeMirzayanov for Codeforces platform and Polygon.

There is no need to read n.B. Moore's LawEvery second the number is multiplied by 1.000000011. Multiplication several times to the same number is equivalent to exponentiation. So the formula is n·1.000000011t (1.000000011 raised to the power of t and then multiplied to n). In a program one should not use a loop to calculate power as it is too slow for such big n, usually a programming language provides a function for exponentiation such as pow.C. Lucky NumbersThere are 2 lucky numbers of the length 1. They are 7 and 8. There are 4 lucky numbers of the length 2. They are 77, 78, 87 and 88. There are 8 lucky numbers of the length 3. They are 777, 778, 787, 788, 877, 878, 887, 888. For each addition of 1 to the length the number of lucky numbers is increased times 2. It is easy to prove: to any number of the previous length one can append 7 or 8, so one number of the prevous length creates two numbers of the next length.So for the length n the amount of lucky numbers of the length exactly n is 2n. But in the problem we need the amount of lucky numbers of length not greater than n. Let's sum up them. 21 = 2, 21 + 22 = 2 + 4 = 6, 21 + 22 + 23 = 2 + 4 + 8 = 14, 21 + 22 + 23 + 24 = 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 30. One can notice that the sum of all previous powers of two is equal to the next power of two minus the first power of two. So the answer to the problem is 2n + 1 - 2.One of the possible implementations of 2n + 1 in a programming language is to shift 1 bitwise to the left for n + 1 binary digits or to shift 2 bitwise to the left for n binary digits. For example, in Java the problem answer formula is (2L << n) - 2, in C++ is (2LL << n) - 2. Suffixes L and LL correspondingly are required so that result of the shift expression have 64-bit integer type (long in Java and long long in C++). Type of the second operand does not matter for the type of shift expression, only the type of the first operand. Also parenthesis are required because without them subtraction is performed first and only then bitwise shift.D. Hexagons!Let's count the number of cells having the distance of exactly n. For n = 0 it is 1, for n = 1 it is 6, for n = 2 it is 12, for n = 3 it is 18 and so on. One can notice that n = 0 is a special case, and then the amount increases by addition of 6. These numbers form an arithmetic progression. In the problem we need to sum these numbers. The formula of the sum of an arithmetic progression is (first + last)·amount / 2. The first is 6, the last is 6n, the amount is n. So the sum is (6 + 6n)n / 2 = 3(n + 1)n. And plus 1 that is not in the arithmetic progression. So the final formula is 1 + 3n(n + 1).To avoid overflow, multiplication in the formula should be performed in 64-bit integer type. For this either 3 or 1 or n should have 64-bit integer type. The literals are 64-bit integer when they have suffix L in Java or LL in C++.E. A rectangleLet's see how the number of affected cells changes depending on the column. For example 3, 2, 3, 2, 3. That is it alternates between the size of the first column and the size of the first column minus one. The amount of \"minus ones\" is the amount of columns divided by 2 rounded down. Without \"minus ones\" all columns have equal size and the total amount of cells is equal to size of the first column multiplied by the number of the columns. The first column size is (y2 - y1) / 2 + 1. The columns amount is x2 - x1 + 1. So the final formula is ((y2 - y1) / 2 + 1)·(x2 - x1 + 1) - (x2 - x1) / 2.To avoid overflow, multiplication should be computed in 64-bit integer type.F. Selection of PersonnelThe amount of ways to choose a group of 5 people from n candidates is equal to the number of combinations , the amount of ways to choose a group of 6 people from n candidates is , the amount of ways to choose a group of 7 people from n candidates is , the amount of ways to choose a group of 5, 6 or 7 people from n candidates is .To avoid 64-bit integer overflow can be calculated in the following way: n / 1 * (n - 1) / 2 * (n - 2) / 3 * (n - 3) / 4 * (n - 4) / 5 * (n - 5) / 6 * (n - 6) / 7. Each division returns an integer because each prefix of this formula after division is also the number of combinations .G. Challenge PennantsFirst of all, ways to place both types of the pennants are independent. So each way to place \"I fixed a critical bug\" pennants on n tables is compatible to each way to place \"I suggested a new feature\" pennants on n tables. Therefore the answer of the problem is equal to the number of ways to place \"I fixed a critical bug\" pennants multiplied by the number of ways to place \"I suggested a new feature\" pennant.The number of ways to place k identical items into n different places when any place can contain any amount of items is the definition of the number of k-combinations with repetitions or k-multicombinations. The formula for the number is .So the whole formula for the problem is .To avoid overflow of 64-bit integer type recommended formulas for computation are (n + 2) / 1 * (n + 1) / 2 * n / 3 and (n + 4) / 1 * (n + 3) / 2 * (n + 2) / 3 * (n + 1) / 4 * n / 5.H. BenchesThe number of ways to choose 5 east to west paths that will have benches from n is . There are n ways to place a bench on the first of these paths. Given the place of the first bench there are n - 1 ways to place a bench on the second of these paths because one of north to south paths is already taken. Given the places of the first and second benches there are n - 2 ways to place a bench on the third of these paths because two of north to south paths are already taken. And the same way n - 3 and n - 4 for the fourth and the fifth benches. Total number of ways to place benches on selected 5 east to west path is n(n - 1)(n - 2)(n - 3)(n - 4). So the formula for the problem is .To avoid 64-bit integer overflow recommended order of computation is exactly as in the formula above, division should not be the last operation.I. Parking LotThere are the following ways to place n cars of the same make. They can be the first n, the last n, or they can be somewhere in the middle of the parking lot.When n cars of the same make are the first or the last, there are 4 ways to choose the make of these n cars, then there are 3 ways to choose the make of one car adjacent to them (the make should be different from the make of n cars) and there are 4 ways to choose the make of each of the remaining n - 3 cars. So the formula for the case of n cars of the same make on either end of the parking lot is 4·3·4n - 3.When n cars of the same make are situated somewhere in the middle, there are 4 ways to choose the make of these n cars, then there are 3 ways to choose the make of each of two cars adjacent to them (the makes of these two cars should be different from the make of n cars) and there are 4 ways to choose the make of each of the remaining n - 4 cars. So the formula for the case of n cars of the same make on a given position somewhere in the middle of the parking lot is 4·32·4n - 4.There are 2 positions of n cars of the same make in the end of the parking lot and there are n - 3 positions of n cars of the same make somewhere in the middle of the parking lot. So the final formula is 2·4·3·4n - 3 + (n - 3)·4·32·4n - 4.J. DivisibilityLet's factorize numbers from 2 to 10. 2 = 2, 3 = 3, 4 = 22, 5 = 5, 6 = 2·3, 7 = 7, 8 = 23, 9 = 32, 10 = 2·5. If a number is divisible by all numbers from 2 to 10, its factorization should contain 2 at least in the power of 3, 3 at least in the power of 2, 5 and 7 at least in the power of 1. So it can be written as x·23·32·5·7 = x·2520. So any number divisible by 2520 is divisible by all numbers from 2 to 10.There are numbers from 1 to n divisible by all numbers from 2 to 10. In a programming language it is usually implemented as simple integer division.K. IndivisibilityThe amount of numbers from 1 to n not divisible by any number from 2 to 10 is equal to the amount of all numbers from 1 to n (that is n) minus the amount of numbers from 1 to n divisible by some number from 2 to 10.The set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by some number from 2 to 10 can be found as union of the set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by 2, the set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by 3 and so on till 10.Note that sets of numbers divisible by 4 or 6 or 8 are subsets of the set of numbers divisible by 2, and sets of numbers divisible by 6 or 9 are subsets of the set of numbers divisible by 3. So there is no need to unite 9 sets, it is enough to unite sets for 2, 3, 5, 7 only.The size of set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by some of 2, 3, 5, 7 can be calculated using inclusion-exclusion principle that says that size of each single set should be added, size of pairwise intersections should be subtracted, size of all intersections of three sets should be added and so on.The size of set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by 2 is equal to , the size of set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by 2 and 3 is equal to and so on.The final formula is Division with rounding down in the formula in a programming language is usually just integer division.L. Cracking the CodeIn this problem just implementation of the actions described in the statement is required. However there are two catches in this problem.The first catch is that the fifth power of five-digit number cannot be represented by a 64-bit integer. But we need not the fifth power, we need the fifth power modulo 105. And mod operation can be applied after each multiplication (see problem A above).The second catch is that you need to output five digits, not the fifth power modulo 105. The difference is when fifth digit from the end is zero. To output a number with the leading zero one can either use corresponding formatting (%05d in printf) or extract digits and output them one by one.M. TurnFirst of all, let's reduce camera rotation angle to [0, 359] degrees range. It is accomplished by the following C++/Java code: angle = (angle % 360 + 360) % 360;Then there are the following cases: [0, 44] degrees — no need to rotate, 45 degrees — 0 or 1 turn to minimum deviation, minimum is 0, [46, 134] degrees — one turn required, 135 degrees — 1 or 2 turns to minimum deviation, minimum is 1, [136, 224] degrees — two turns required, 225 degrees — 2 or 3 turns to minimum deviation, minimum is 2, [226, 314] degrees — three turns required, 315 degrees — 3 or 0 turns to minimum deviation, minimum is 0, [316, 359] degrees — no need to rotate. Let's add 44 degrees to the angle from the range [0, 359]. C++/Java code is angle = (angle + 44) % 360; Then the ranges will be: [0, 89] degrees — 0 turns, [90, 179] degrees — 1 turn, [180, 269] degrees — 2 turns, [270, 358] degrees — 3 turns, 359 degrees — 0 turns. One special case of 359 degrees can be eliminated by taking angle modulo 359. Then just integer division by 90 is required to get the answer. C++/Java code is answer = (angle % 359) / 90;N. ForecastThere is nothing special in solving a quadratic equation but the problem has one catch. You should output the greater root first.The simplest approach is to output max(x1, x2) first, then min(x1, x2).Another approach is based upon the sign of a. for a > 0 and for a < 0.We can divide all coefficients by a, and then the first coefficient will be positive. But notice that division should be done in a floating point type and a should be divided last otherwise resulting a / a = 1 would not be able to divide b and c.O. ArrowTo get a vector of the given length b in the direction of the given vector (vx, vy) it is just required to normalize the given vector (divide it by its length) and then multiply by b.Let's denote , vnx = vx / len, vny = vy / len. Then (vnx, vny) is the normalized vector, and the first point of the arrow is (px + vnx·b, py + vny·b).To get the second point of the arrow one needs to rotate the normalized vector 90 degrees counter-clockwise and then multiply by the half of the triangle base a / 2. Let's denote vlx =  - vny, vly = vnx. Then (vlx, vly) is the normalized vector 90 degrees counter-clockwise to (vnx, vny). So the second point of the arrow is (px + vlx·a / 2, py + vly·a / 2).The third point can be found the same way as the second point but the length of the vector to it is c / 2. So the third point of the arrow is (px + vlx·c / 2, py + vly·c / 2).The fourth point can be found by adding the vector of the length c / 2 to the left of the given and the vector of the length d reverse to the given. So the fourth point of the arrow is (px + vlx·c / 2 - vnx·d, py + vly·c / 2 - vny·d).The remaining points are symmetrical to the points discussed above so they can be obtained the same way, just using minus for (vlx, vly) instead of plus. So the next points are (px - vlx·c / 2 - vnx·d, py - vly·c / 2 - vny·d), (px - vlx·c / 2, py - vly·c / 2), (px - vlx·a / 2, py - vly·a / 2).P. Area of a Star where n in the number of the star corners because in a regular star all angles between corners are equal. because of symmetry. because it is an inscribed angle. because of symmetry.So we know OA = r and and . We can calculate the area of AOB triangle knowing the length of a side and two angles adjacent to it using formula .The whole star area is equal to 2n areas of AOB triangle because of symmetry. .Q. PyramidsThe volume of a pyramid can be calculated as where v is the volume, s is the area of the base and h is the height from the base to the apex. Let's calculate s and h.The area of a regular polygon having n sides of length ln can be found the following way.On the figure above a regular polygon is shown. O is the center of the polygon, all sides are equal to ln, OB is the altitude of AOC triangle. As the polygon is a regular one OA = OC, AOC triangle is a isosceles one and then and AB = BC, also AOB and COB triangles are right-angled ones. Also because the polygon is a regular one and can be seen as a union of 2n triangles equal to AOB triangle then .AOB triangle is right-angled one, so , . Also . So and . The area of AOB is equal to . The area of the polygon is .On the figure above a triangle formed by the pyramid apex H, the center of the base O and some vertex of the base A is shown. It is a right-angled one. As all edges of the pyramid are equal, AH = ln and from calculations above . According to Pythagorean theorem OA2 + OH2 = AH2. So .The volume of one piramid is .And the final formula is .R. GameFor the field of an even size there is a winning strategy for the second player. Namely, to paint a cell that is symmetrical with respect to the center of the field to the cell painted by the first player on the previous turn. After each turn of the second player the field is centrosymmetrical and so there is always a cell that can be painted that is symmetrical with respect to the center of the field to any cell that the first player can choose to paint. .... 1... .1.. .... ....\n.... .... .... 1... .1..\n.... .... .... ...2 ..2.\n.... ...2 ..2. .... ....For the field of an odd size there is a winning strategy for the first player. Namely, on the first turn to paint the central cell, then to paint a cell that is symmetrical with respect to the center of the field to the cell painted by the second player on the previous turn. After each turn of the first player the field is centrosymmetrical and so there is always a cell that can be painted that is symmetrical with respect to the center of the field to any cell that the second player can choose to paint. ..... 2.... .2... ..2.. .....\n..... ..... ..... ..... .2...\n..1.. ..1.. ..1.. ..1.. ..1..\n..... ..... ..... ..... ...1.\n..... ....1 ...1. ..1.. .....So for even n the answer is 2, for odd n the answer is 1. One of the possible formulas for the problem is .n can be up to 1018 so at least 64-bit integer type should be used to input it.",

На этот раз набор задач рекомендован для участников из Div.2.Раунд будет нерейтинговым для всех участников. Соревнование будет проводиться согласно стандартным правилам ACM ICPC. У Вас будет 180 минут (три часа), чтобы решить 18 задач. После раунда не будет фазы взломов.Наша основная целевая аудитория — начинающие и члены Div. 2. Все предложенные задачи могут быть решены без условий и циклов. Требуются только формулы. Присваивания и функции могут быть использованы для сокращения дублирования кода.Темы задач: комбинаторика геометрия теория игр последовательности другое Раунд подготовлен как часть комплекса мероприятий Вологодский БИТ, также как часть этих мероприятий проходили вебинары «Олимпиадное программирование с нуля на Java», посвящённые перечисленным выше темам. Записи вебинаров доступны на YouTube (на русском).Раунд был подготовлен мной, Фёдором Меньшиковым mfv, Игорем Андриановым igand и Олегом Стрекаловским OSt. Особая благодарность Марии Беловой Delinur за вычитку и исправление условий на английском и конечно Михаилу Мирзаянову MikeMirzayanov за платформу Codeforces и Полигон. Полигон сделал чекеры и тесты для этого соревнования лучше.UPD: Разбор задач завершён.",

This time the problemset is recommended for Div.2 participants.The round will be unrated for all users and it will be held according to the standard ACM-ICPC rules. You will have 180 minutes (three hours) to solve 18 problems. There will be no open hacks phase after the round.Our main target audience is beginners and Div. 2 members. All offered problems can be solved without conditional constructs and without loops. Only formulas are required. Assignments and functions can be used to reduce code duplication.The topics of the problems are: combinatorics geometry game theory sequences other The round is created as a part of Vologda BIT event, also as part of this event “Contest programming from zero in Java” webinars were held devoted to the topics listed above. Recordings of the webinars are available on YouTube (in Russian).The round was prepared by me, Fyodor Menshikov mfv, Igor Andrianov igand and Oleg Strekalovsky OSt. Special thanks to Maria Belova Delinur for bugfixing the English statements and of course to MikeMirzayanov for Codeforces platform and Polygon.

          "content": "A. Again Twenty Five!The problem of getting the last two digits is equivalent to the problem of getting the number modulo 100. So we need to calculate . According to the rules of modular arithmeticSoLet's note that 52 = 25. ThenAnd so on. All are equal to 25 for all n ≥ 2.So to solve the problem one need to just output 25. There is no need to read n.B. Moore's LawEvery second the number is multiplied by 1.000000011. Multiplication several times to the same number is equivalent to exponentiation. So the formula is n·1.000000011t (1.000000011 raised to the power of t and then multiplied to n). In a program one should not use a loop to calculate power as it is too slow for such big n, usually a programming language provides a function for exponentiation such as pow.C. Lucky NumbersThere are 2 lucky numbers of the length 1. They are 7 and 8. There are 4 lucky numbers of the length 2. They are 77, 78, 87 and 88. There are 8 lucky numbers of the length 3. They are 777, 778, 787, 788, 877, 878, 887, 888. For each addition of 1 to the length the number of lucky numbers is increased times 2. It is easy to prove: to any number of the previous length one can append 7 or 8, so one number of the prevous length creates two numbers of the next length.So for the length n the amount of lucky numbers of the length exactly n is 2n. But in the problem we need the amount of lucky numbers of length not greater than n. Let's sum up them. 21 = 2, 21 + 22 = 2 + 4 = 6, 21 + 22 + 23 = 2 + 4 + 8 = 14, 21 + 22 + 23 + 24 = 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 30. One can notice that the sum of all previous powers of two is equal to the next power of two minus the first power of two. So the answer to the problem is 2n + 1 - 2.One of the possible implementations of 2n + 1 in a programming language is to shift 1 bitwise to the left for n + 1 binary digits or to shift 2 bitwise to the left for n binary digits. For example, in Java the problem answer formula is (2L << n) - 2, in C++ is (2LL << n) - 2. Suffixes L and LL correspondingly are required so that result of the shift expression have 64-bit integer type (long in Java and long long in C++). Type of the second operand does not matter for the type of shift expression, only the type of the first operand. Also parenthesis are required because without them subtraction is performed first and only then bitwise shift.D. Hexagons!Let's count the number of cells having the distance of exactly n. For n = 0 it is 1, for n = 1 it is 6, for n = 2 it is 12, for n = 3 it is 18 and so on. One can notice that n = 0 is a special case, and then the amount increases by addition of 6. These numbers form an arithmetic progression. In the problem we need to sum these numbers. The formula of the sum of an arithmetic progression is (first + last)·amount / 2. The first is 6, the last is 6n, the amount is n. So the sum is (6 + 6n)n / 2 = 3(n + 1)n. And plus 1 that is not in the arithmetic progression. So the final formula is 1 + 3n(n + 1).To avoid overflow, multiplication in the formula should be performed in 64-bit integer type. For this either 3 or 1 or n should have 64-bit integer type. The literals are 64-bit integer when they have suffix L in Java or LL in C++.E. A rectangleLet's see how the number of affected cells changes depending on the column. For example 3, 2, 3, 2, 3. That is it alternates between the size of the first column and the size of the first column minus one. The amount of \"minus ones\" is the amount of columns divided by 2 rounded down. Without \"minus ones\" all columns have equal size and the total amount of cells is equal to size of the first column multiplied by the number of the columns. The first column size is (y2 - y1) / 2 + 1. The columns amount is x2 - x1 + 1. So the final formula is ((y2 - y1) / 2 + 1)·(x2 - x1 + 1) - (x2 - x1) / 2.To avoid overflow, multiplication should be computed in 64-bit integer type.F. Selection of PersonnelThe amount of ways to choose a group of 5 people from n candidates is equal to the number of combinations , the amount of ways to choose a group of 6 people from n candidates is , the amount of ways to choose a group of 7 people from n candidates is , the amount of ways to choose a group of 5, 6 or 7 people from n candidates is .To avoid 64-bit integer overflow can be calculated in the following way: n / 1 * (n - 1) / 2 * (n - 2) / 3 * (n - 3) / 4 * (n - 4) / 5 * (n - 5) / 6 * (n - 6) / 7. Each division returns an integer because each prefix of this formula after division is also the number of combinations .G. Challenge PennantsFirst of all, ways to place both types of the pennants are independent. So each way to place \"I fixed a critical bug\" pennants on n tables is compatible to each way to place \"I suggested a new feature\" pennants on n tables. Therefore the answer of the problem is equal to the number of ways to place \"I fixed a critical bug\" pennants multiplied by the number of ways to place \"I suggested a new feature\" pennant.The number of ways to place k identical items into n different places when any place can contain any amount of items is the definition of the number of k-combinations with repetitions or k-multicombinations. The formula for the number is .So the whole formula for the problem is .To avoid overflow of 64-bit integer type recommended formulas for computation are (n + 2) / 1 * (n + 1) / 2 * n / 3 and (n + 4) / 1 * (n + 3) / 2 * (n + 2) / 3 * (n + 1) / 4 * n / 5.H. BenchesThe number of ways to choose 5 east to west paths that will have benches from n is . There are n ways to place a bench on the first of these paths. Given the place of the first bench there are n - 1 ways to place a bench on the second of these paths because one of north to south paths is already taken. Given the places of the first and second benches there are n - 2 ways to place a bench on the third of these paths because two of north to south paths are already taken. And the same way n - 3 and n - 4 for the fourth and the fifth benches. Total number of ways to place benches on selected 5 east to west path is n(n - 1)(n - 2)(n - 3)(n - 4). So the formula for the problem is .To avoid 64-bit integer overflow recommended order of computation is exactly as in the formula above, division should not be the last operation.I. Parking LotThere are the following ways to place n cars of the same make. They can be the first n, the last n, or they can be somewhere in the middle of the parking lot.When n cars of the same make are the first or the last, there are 4 ways to choose the make of these n cars, then there are 3 ways to choose the make of one car adjacent to them (the make should be different from the make of n cars) and there are 4 ways to choose the make of each of the remaining n - 3 cars. So the formula for the case of n cars of the same make on either end of the parking lot is 4·3·4n - 3.When n cars of the same make are situated somewhere in the middle, there are 4 ways to choose the make of these n cars, then there are 3 ways to choose the make of each of two cars adjacent to them (the makes of these two cars should be different from the make of n cars) and there are 4 ways to choose the make of each of the remaining n - 4 cars. So the formula for the case of n cars of the same make on a given position somewhere in the middle of the parking lot is 4·32·4n - 4.There are 2 positions of n cars of the same make in the end of the parking lot and there are n - 3 positions of n cars of the same make somewhere in the middle of the parking lot. So the final formula is 2·4·3·4n - 3 + (n - 3)·4·32·4n - 4.J. DivisibilityLet's factorize numbers from 2 to 10. 2 = 2, 3 = 3, 4 = 22, 5 = 5, 6 = 2·3, 7 = 7, 8 = 23, 9 = 32, 10 = 2·5. If a number is divisible by all numbers from 2 to 10, its factorization should contain 2 at least in the power of 3, 3 at least in the power of 2, 5 and 7 at least in the power of 1. So it can be written as x·23·32·5·7 = x·2520. So any number divisible by 2520 is divisible by all numbers from 2 to 10.There are numbers from 1 to n divisible by all numbers from 2 to 10. In a programming language it is usually implemented as simple integer division.K. IndivisibilityThe amount of numbers from 1 to n not divisible by any number from 2 to 10 is equal to the amount of all numbers from 1 to n (that is n) minus the amount of numbers from 1 to n divisible by some number from 2 to 10.The set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by some number from 2 to 10 can be found as union of the set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by 2, the set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by 3 and so on till 10.Note that sets of numbers divisible by 4 or 6 or 8 are subsets of the set of numbers divisible by 2, and sets of numbers divisible by 6 or 9 are subsets of the set of numbers divisible by 3. So there is no need to unite 9 sets, it is enough to unite sets for 2, 3, 5, 7 only.The size of set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by some of 2, 3, 5, 7 can be calculated using inclusion-exclusion principle that says that size of each single set should be added, size of pairwise intersections should be subtracted, size of all intersections of three sets should be added and so on.The size of set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by 2 is equal to , the size of set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by 2 and 3 is equal to and so on.The final formula is Division with rounding down in the formula in a programming language is usually just integer division.L. Cracking the CodeIn this problem just implementation of the actions described in the statement is required. However there are two catches in this problem.The first catch is that the fifth power of five-digit number cannot be represented by a 64-bit integer. But we need not the fifth power, we need the fifth power modulo 105. And mod operation can be applied after each multiplication (see problem A above).The second catch is that you need to output five digits, not the fifth power modulo 105. The difference is when fifth digit from the end is zero. To output a number with the leading zero one can either use corresponding formatting (%05d in printf) or extract digits and output them one by one.M. TurnFirst of all, let's reduce camera rotation angle to [0, 359] degrees range. It is accomplished by the following C++/Java code: angle = (angle % 360 + 360) % 360;Then there are the following cases: [0, 44] degrees — no need to rotate, 45 degrees — 0 or 1 turn to minimum deviation, minimum is 0, [46, 134] degrees — one turn required, 135 degrees — 1 or 2 turns to minimum deviation, minimum is 1, [136, 224] degrees — two turns required, 225 degrees — 2 or 3 turns to minimum deviation, minimum is 2, [226, 314] degrees — three turns required, 315 degrees — 3 or 0 turns to minimum deviation, minimum is 0, [316, 359] degrees — no need to rotate. Let's add 44 degrees to the angle from the range [0, 359]. C++/Java code is angle = (angle + 44) % 360; Then the ranges will be: [0, 89] degrees — 0 turns, [90, 179] degrees — 1 turn, [180, 269] degrees — 2 turns, [270, 358] degrees — 3 turns, 359 degrees — 0 turns. One special case of 359 degrees can be eliminated by taking angle modulo 359. Then just integer division by 90 is required to get the answer. C++/Java code is answer = (angle % 359) / 90;N. ForecastThere is nothing special in solving a quadratic equation but the problem has one catch. You should output the greater root first.The simplest approach is to output max(x1, x2) first, then min(x1, x2).Another approach is based upon the sign of a. for a > 0 and for a < 0.We can divide all coefficients by a, and then the first coefficient will be positive. But notice that division should be done in a floating point type and a should be divided last otherwise resulting a / a = 1 would not be able to divide b and c.O. ArrowTo get a vector of the given length b in the direction of the given vector (vx, vy) it is just required to normalize the given vector (divide it by its length) and then multiply by b.Let's denote , vnx = vx / len, vny = vy / len. Then (vnx, vny) is the normalized vector, and the first point of the arrow is (px + vnx·b, py + vny·b).To get the second point of the arrow one needs to rotate the normalized vector 90 degrees counter-clockwise and then multiply by the half of the triangle base a / 2. Let's denote vlx =  - vny, vly = vnx. Then (vlx, vly) is the normalized vector 90 degrees counter-clockwise to (vnx, vny). So the second point of the arrow is (px + vlx·a / 2, py + vly·a / 2).The third point can be found the same way as the second point but the length of the vector to it is c / 2. So the third point of the arrow is (px + vlx·c / 2, py + vly·c / 2).The fourth point can be found by adding the vector of the length c / 2 to the left of the given and the vector of the length d reverse to the given. So the fourth point of the arrow is (px + vlx·c / 2 - vnx·d, py + vly·c / 2 - vny·d).The remaining points are symmetrical to the points discussed above so they can be obtained the same way, just using minus for (vlx, vly) instead of plus. So the next points are (px - vlx·c / 2 - vnx·d, py - vly·c / 2 - vny·d), (px - vlx·c / 2, py - vly·c / 2), (px - vlx·a / 2, py - vly·a / 2).P. Area of a Star where n in the number of the star corners because in a regular star all angles between corners are equal. because of symmetry. because it is an inscribed angle. because of symmetry.So we know OA = r and and . We can calculate the area of AOB triangle knowing the length of a side and two angles adjacent to it using formula .The whole star area is equal to 2n areas of AOB triangle because of symmetry. .Q. PyramidsThe volume of a pyramid can be calculated as where v is the volume, s is the area of the base and h is the height from the base to the apex. Let's calculate s and h.The area of a regular polygon having n sides of length ln can be found the following way.On the figure above a regular polygon is shown. O is the center of the polygon, all sides are equal to ln, OB is the altitude of AOC triangle. As the polygon is a regular one OA = OC, AOC triangle is a isosceles one and then and AB = BC, also AOB and COB triangles are right-angled ones. Also because the polygon is a regular one and can be seen as a union of 2n triangles equal to AOB triangle then .AOB triangle is right-angled one, so , . Also . So and . The area of AOB is equal to . The area of the polygon is .On the figure above a triangle formed by the pyramid apex H, the center of the base O and some vertex of the base A is shown. It is a right-angled one. As all edges of the pyramid are equal, AH = ln and from calculations above . According to Pythagorean theorem OA2 + OH2 = AH2. So .The volume of one piramid is .And the final formula is .R. GameFor the field of an even size there is a winning strategy for the second player. Namely, to paint a cell that is symmetrical with respect to the center of the field to the cell painted by the first player on the previous turn. After each turn of the second player the field is centrosymmetrical and so there is always a cell that can be painted that is symmetrical with respect to the center of the field to any cell that the first player can choose to paint. .... 1... .1.. .... ....\n.... .... .... 1... .1..\n.... .... .... ...2 ..2.\n.... ...2 ..2. .... ....For the field of an odd size there is a winning strategy for the first player. Namely, on the first turn to paint the central cell, then to paint a cell that is symmetrical with respect to the center of the field to the cell painted by the second player on the previous turn. After each turn of the first player the field is centrosymmetrical and so there is always a cell that can be painted that is symmetrical with respect to the center of the field to any cell that the second player can choose to paint. ..... 2.... .2... ..2.. .....\n..... ..... ..... ..... .2...\n..1.. ..1.. ..1.. ..1.. ..1..\n..... ..... ..... ..... ...1.\n..... ....1 ...1. ..1.. .....So for even n the answer is 2, for odd n the answer is 1. One of the possible formulas for the problem is .n can be up to 1018 so at least 64-bit integer type should be used to input it.",

На этот раз набор задач рекомендован для участников из Div.2.Раунд будет нерейтинговым для всех участников. Соревнование будет проводиться согласно стандартным правилам ACM ICPC. У Вас будет 180 минут (три часа), чтобы решить 18 задач. После раунда не будет фазы взломов.Наша основная целевая аудитория — начинающие и члены Div. 2. Все предложенные задачи могут быть решены без условий и циклов. Требуются только формулы. Присваивания и функции могут быть использованы для сокращения дублирования кода.Темы задач: комбинаторика геометрия теория игр последовательности другое Раунд подготовлен как часть комплекса мероприятий Вологодский БИТ, также как часть этих мероприятий проходили вебинары «Олимпиадное программирование с нуля на Java», посвящённые перечисленным выше темам. Записи вебинаров доступны на YouTube (на русском).Раунд был подготовлен мной, Фёдором Меньшиковым mfv, Игорем Андриановым igand и Олегом Стрекаловским OSt. Особая благодарность Марии Беловой Delinur за вычитку и исправление условий на английском и конечно Михаилу Мирзаянову MikeMirzayanov за платформу Codeforces и Полигон. Полигон сделал чекеры и тесты для этого соревнования лучше.UPD: Разбор задач завершён.",

This time the problemset is recommended for Div.2 participants.The round will be unrated for all users and it will be held according to the standard ACM-ICPC rules. You will have 180 minutes (three hours) to solve 18 problems. There will be no open hacks phase after the round.Our main target audience is beginners and Div. 2 members. All offered problems can be solved without conditional constructs and without loops. Only formulas are required. Assignments and functions can be used to reduce code duplication.The topics of the problems are: combinatorics geometry game theory sequences other The round is created as a part of Vologda BIT event, also as part of this event “Contest programming from zero in Java” webinars were held devoted to the topics listed above. Recordings of the webinars are available on YouTube (in Russian).The round was prepared by me, Fyodor Menshikov mfv, Igor Andrianov igand and Oleg Strekalovsky OSt. Special thanks to Maria Belova Delinur for bugfixing the English statements and of course to MikeMirzayanov for Codeforces platform and Polygon.

          "content": "A. Again Twenty Five!The problem of getting the last two digits is equivalent to the problem of getting the number modulo 100. So we need to calculate . According to the rules of modular arithmeticSoLet's note that 52 = 25. ThenAnd so on. All are equal to 25 for all n ≥ 2.So to solve the problem one need to just output 25. There is no need to read n.B. Moore's LawEvery second the number is multiplied by 1.000000011. Multiplication several times to the same number is equivalent to exponentiation. So the formula is n·1.000000011t (1.000000011 raised to the power of t and then multiplied to n). In a program one should not use a loop to calculate power as it is too slow for such big n, usually a programming language provides a function for exponentiation such as pow.C. Lucky NumbersThere are 2 lucky numbers of the length 1. They are 7 and 8. There are 4 lucky numbers of the length 2. They are 77, 78, 87 and 88. There are 8 lucky numbers of the length 3. They are 777, 778, 787, 788, 877, 878, 887, 888. For each addition of 1 to the length the number of lucky numbers is increased times 2. It is easy to prove: to any number of the previous length one can append 7 or 8, so one number of the prevous length creates two numbers of the next length.So for the length n the amount of lucky numbers of the length exactly n is 2n. But in the problem we need the amount of lucky numbers of length not greater than n. Let's sum up them. 21 = 2, 21 + 22 = 2 + 4 = 6, 21 + 22 + 23 = 2 + 4 + 8 = 14, 21 + 22 + 23 + 24 = 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 30. One can notice that the sum of all previous powers of two is equal to the next power of two minus the first power of two. So the answer to the problem is 2n + 1 - 2.One of the possible implementations of 2n + 1 in a programming language is to shift 1 bitwise to the left for n + 1 binary digits or to shift 2 bitwise to the left for n binary digits. For example, in Java the problem answer formula is (2L << n) - 2, in C++ is (2LL << n) - 2. Suffixes L and LL correspondingly are required so that result of the shift expression have 64-bit integer type (long in Java and long long in C++). Type of the second operand does not matter for the type of shift expression, only the type of the first operand. Also parenthesis are required because without them subtraction is performed first and only then bitwise shift.D. Hexagons!Let's count the number of cells having the distance of exactly n. For n = 0 it is 1, for n = 1 it is 6, for n = 2 it is 12, for n = 3 it is 18 and so on. One can notice that n = 0 is a special case, and then the amount increases by addition of 6. These numbers form an arithmetic progression. In the problem we need to sum these numbers. The formula of the sum of an arithmetic progression is (first + last)·amount / 2. The first is 6, the last is 6n, the amount is n. So the sum is (6 + 6n)n / 2 = 3(n + 1)n. And plus 1 that is not in the arithmetic progression. So the final formula is 1 + 3n(n + 1).To avoid overflow, multiplication in the formula should be performed in 64-bit integer type. For this either 3 or 1 or n should have 64-bit integer type. The literals are 64-bit integer when they have suffix L in Java or LL in C++.E. A rectangleLet's see how the number of affected cells changes depending on the column. For example 3, 2, 3, 2, 3. That is it alternates between the size of the first column and the size of the first column minus one. The amount of \"minus ones\" is the amount of columns divided by 2 rounded down. Without \"minus ones\" all columns have equal size and the total amount of cells is equal to size of the first column multiplied by the number of the columns. The first column size is (y2 - y1) / 2 + 1. The columns amount is x2 - x1 + 1. So the final formula is ((y2 - y1) / 2 + 1)·(x2 - x1 + 1) - (x2 - x1) / 2.To avoid overflow, multiplication should be computed in 64-bit integer type.F. Selection of PersonnelThe amount of ways to choose a group of 5 people from n candidates is equal to the number of combinations , the amount of ways to choose a group of 6 people from n candidates is , the amount of ways to choose a group of 7 people from n candidates is , the amount of ways to choose a group of 5, 6 or 7 people from n candidates is .To avoid 64-bit integer overflow can be calculated in the following way: n / 1 * (n - 1) / 2 * (n - 2) / 3 * (n - 3) / 4 * (n - 4) / 5 * (n - 5) / 6 * (n - 6) / 7. Each division returns an integer because each prefix of this formula after division is also the number of combinations .G. Challenge PennantsFirst of all, ways to place both types of the pennants are independent. So each way to place \"I fixed a critical bug\" pennants on n tables is compatible to each way to place \"I suggested a new feature\" pennants on n tables. Therefore the answer of the problem is equal to the number of ways to place \"I fixed a critical bug\" pennants multiplied by the number of ways to place \"I suggested a new feature\" pennant.The number of ways to place k identical items into n different places when any place can contain any amount of items is the definition of the number of k-combinations with repetitions or k-multicombinations. The formula for the number is .So the whole formula for the problem is .To avoid overflow of 64-bit integer type recommended formulas for computation are (n + 2) / 1 * (n + 1) / 2 * n / 3 and (n + 4) / 1 * (n + 3) / 2 * (n + 2) / 3 * (n + 1) / 4 * n / 5.H. BenchesThe number of ways to choose 5 east to west paths that will have benches from n is . There are n ways to place a bench on the first of these paths. Given the place of the first bench there are n - 1 ways to place a bench on the second of these paths because one of north to south paths is already taken. Given the places of the first and second benches there are n - 2 ways to place a bench on the third of these paths because two of north to south paths are already taken. And the same way n - 3 and n - 4 for the fourth and the fifth benches. Total number of ways to place benches on selected 5 east to west path is n(n - 1)(n - 2)(n - 3)(n - 4). So the formula for the problem is .To avoid 64-bit integer overflow recommended order of computation is exactly as in the formula above, division should not be the last operation.I. Parking LotThere are the following ways to place n cars of the same make. They can be the first n, the last n, or they can be somewhere in the middle of the parking lot.When n cars of the same make are the first or the last, there are 4 ways to choose the make of these n cars, then there are 3 ways to choose the make of one car adjacent to them (the make should be different from the make of n cars) and there are 4 ways to choose the make of each of the remaining n - 3 cars. So the formula for the case of n cars of the same make on either end of the parking lot is 4·3·4n - 3.When n cars of the same make are situated somewhere in the middle, there are 4 ways to choose the make of these n cars, then there are 3 ways to choose the make of each of two cars adjacent to them (the makes of these two cars should be different from the make of n cars) and there are 4 ways to choose the make of each of the remaining n - 4 cars. So the formula for the case of n cars of the same make on a given position somewhere in the middle of the parking lot is 4·32·4n - 4.There are 2 positions of n cars of the same make in the end of the parking lot and there are n - 3 positions of n cars of the same make somewhere in the middle of the parking lot. So the final formula is 2·4·3·4n - 3 + (n - 3)·4·32·4n - 4.J. DivisibilityLet's factorize numbers from 2 to 10. 2 = 2, 3 = 3, 4 = 22, 5 = 5, 6 = 2·3, 7 = 7, 8 = 23, 9 = 32, 10 = 2·5. If a number is divisible by all numbers from 2 to 10, its factorization should contain 2 at least in the power of 3, 3 at least in the power of 2, 5 and 7 at least in the power of 1. So it can be written as x·23·32·5·7 = x·2520. So any number divisible by 2520 is divisible by all numbers from 2 to 10.There are numbers from 1 to n divisible by all numbers from 2 to 10. In a programming language it is usually implemented as simple integer division.K. IndivisibilityThe amount of numbers from 1 to n not divisible by any number from 2 to 10 is equal to the amount of all numbers from 1 to n (that is n) minus the amount of numbers from 1 to n divisible by some number from 2 to 10.The set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by some number from 2 to 10 can be found as union of the set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by 2, the set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by 3 and so on till 10.Note that sets of numbers divisible by 4 or 6 or 8 are subsets of the set of numbers divisible by 2, and sets of numbers divisible by 6 or 9 are subsets of the set of numbers divisible by 3. So there is no need to unite 9 sets, it is enough to unite sets for 2, 3, 5, 7 only.The size of set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by some of 2, 3, 5, 7 can be calculated using inclusion-exclusion principle that says that size of each single set should be added, size of pairwise intersections should be subtracted, size of all intersections of three sets should be added and so on.The size of set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by 2 is equal to , the size of set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by 2 and 3 is equal to and so on.The final formula is Division with rounding down in the formula in a programming language is usually just integer division.L. Cracking the CodeIn this problem just implementation of the actions described in the statement is required. However there are two catches in this problem.The first catch is that the fifth power of five-digit number cannot be represented by a 64-bit integer. But we need not the fifth power, we need the fifth power modulo 105. And mod operation can be applied after each multiplication (see problem A above).The second catch is that you need to output five digits, not the fifth power modulo 105. The difference is when fifth digit from the end is zero. To output a number with the leading zero one can either use corresponding formatting (%05d in printf) or extract digits and output them one by one.M. TurnFirst of all, let's reduce camera rotation angle to [0, 359] degrees range. It is accomplished by the following C++/Java code: angle = (angle % 360 + 360) % 360;Then there are the following cases: [0, 44] degrees — no need to rotate, 45 degrees — 0 or 1 turn to minimum deviation, minimum is 0, [46, 134] degrees — one turn required, 135 degrees — 1 or 2 turns to minimum deviation, minimum is 1, [136, 224] degrees — two turns required, 225 degrees — 2 or 3 turns to minimum deviation, minimum is 2, [226, 314] degrees — three turns required, 315 degrees — 3 or 0 turns to minimum deviation, minimum is 0, [316, 359] degrees — no need to rotate. Let's add 44 degrees to the angle from the range [0, 359]. C++/Java code is angle = (angle + 44) % 360; Then the ranges will be: [0, 89] degrees — 0 turns, [90, 179] degrees — 1 turn, [180, 269] degrees — 2 turns, [270, 358] degrees — 3 turns, 359 degrees — 0 turns. One special case of 359 degrees can be eliminated by taking angle modulo 359. Then just integer division by 90 is required to get the answer. C++/Java code is answer = (angle % 359) / 90;N. ForecastThere is nothing special in solving a quadratic equation but the problem has one catch. You should output the greater root first.The simplest approach is to output max(x1, x2) first, then min(x1, x2).Another approach is based upon the sign of a. for a > 0 and for a < 0.We can divide all coefficients by a, and then the first coefficient will be positive. But notice that division should be done in a floating point type and a should be divided last otherwise resulting a / a = 1 would not be able to divide b and c.O. ArrowTo get a vector of the given length b in the direction of the given vector (vx, vy) it is just required to normalize the given vector (divide it by its length) and then multiply by b.Let's denote , vnx = vx / len, vny = vy / len. Then (vnx, vny) is the normalized vector, and the first point of the arrow is (px + vnx·b, py + vny·b).To get the second point of the arrow one needs to rotate the normalized vector 90 degrees counter-clockwise and then multiply by the half of the triangle base a / 2. Let's denote vlx =  - vny, vly = vnx. Then (vlx, vly) is the normalized vector 90 degrees counter-clockwise to (vnx, vny). So the second point of the arrow is (px + vlx·a / 2, py + vly·a / 2).The third point can be found the same way as the second point but the length of the vector to it is c / 2. So the third point of the arrow is (px + vlx·c / 2, py + vly·c / 2).The fourth point can be found by adding the vector of the length c / 2 to the left of the given and the vector of the length d reverse to the given. So the fourth point of the arrow is (px + vlx·c / 2 - vnx·d, py + vly·c / 2 - vny·d).The remaining points are symmetrical to the points discussed above so they can be obtained the same way, just using minus for (vlx, vly) instead of plus. So the next points are (px - vlx·c / 2 - vnx·d, py - vly·c / 2 - vny·d), (px - vlx·c / 2, py - vly·c / 2), (px - vlx·a / 2, py - vly·a / 2).P. Area of a Star where n in the number of the star corners because in a regular star all angles between corners are equal. because of symmetry. because it is an inscribed angle. because of symmetry.So we know OA = r and and . We can calculate the area of AOB triangle knowing the length of a side and two angles adjacent to it using formula .The whole star area is equal to 2n areas of AOB triangle because of symmetry. .Q. PyramidsThe volume of a pyramid can be calculated as where v is the volume, s is the area of the base and h is the height from the base to the apex. Let's calculate s and h.The area of a regular polygon having n sides of length ln can be found the following way.On the figure above a regular polygon is shown. O is the center of the polygon, all sides are equal to ln, OB is the altitude of AOC triangle. As the polygon is a regular one OA = OC, AOC triangle is a isosceles one and then and AB = BC, also AOB and COB triangles are right-angled ones. Also because the polygon is a regular one and can be seen as a union of 2n triangles equal to AOB triangle then .AOB triangle is right-angled one, so , . Also . So and . The area of AOB is equal to . The area of the polygon is .On the figure above a triangle formed by the pyramid apex H, the center of the base O and some vertex of the base A is shown. It is a right-angled one. As all edges of the pyramid are equal, AH = ln and from calculations above . According to Pythagorean theorem OA2 + OH2 = AH2. So .The volume of one piramid is .And the final formula is .R. GameFor the field of an even size there is a winning strategy for the second player. Namely, to paint a cell that is symmetrical with respect to the center of the field to the cell painted by the first player on the previous turn. After each turn of the second player the field is centrosymmetrical and so there is always a cell that can be painted that is symmetrical with respect to the center of the field to any cell that the first player can choose to paint. .... 1... .1.. .... ....\n.... .... .... 1... .1..\n.... .... .... ...2 ..2.\n.... ...2 ..2. .... ....For the field of an odd size there is a winning strategy for the first player. Namely, on the first turn to paint the central cell, then to paint a cell that is symmetrical with respect to the center of the field to the cell painted by the second player on the previous turn. After each turn of the first player the field is centrosymmetrical and so there is always a cell that can be painted that is symmetrical with respect to the center of the field to any cell that the second player can choose to paint. ..... 2.... .2... ..2.. .....\n..... ..... ..... ..... .2...\n..1.. ..1.. ..1.. ..1.. ..1..\n..... ..... ..... ..... ...1.\n..... ....1 ...1. ..1.. .....So for even n the answer is 2, for odd n the answer is 1. One of the possible formulas for the problem is .n can be up to 1018 so at least 64-bit integer type should be used to input it.",

Один поворот изображения на 90 градусов по часовой стрелке даёт общий поворот в 150 градусов по часовой стрелке, и отклонение от «истинного верха» для одного поворота составляет 150 градусов. Два поворота изображения на 90 градусов по часовой стрелке дают общий поворот в 240 градусов по часовой стрелке, и отклонение от «истинного верха» для двух поворотов составляет 120 градусов, потому что 240 градусов по часовой стрелке — это то же самое, что 120 градусов против часовой стрелки. Три поворота изображения на 90 градусов дают общий поворот 330 градусов по часовой стрелке, и отклонение от «истинного верха» для трёх поворотов составляет 30 градусов, потому что 330 градусов по часовой стрелке — это то же самое, что 30 градусов против часовой стрелки.Из отклонений 60, 150, 120 и 30 градусов минимальным является 30, оно достигается при трёх поворотах изображения на 90 градусов по часовой стрелке.",

На этот раз набор задач рекомендован для участников из Div.2.Раунд будет нерейтинговым для всех участников. Соревнование будет проводиться согласно стандартным правилам ACM ICPC. У Вас будет 180 минут (три часа), чтобы решить 18 задач. После раунда не будет фазы взломов.Наша основная целевая аудитория — начинающие и члены Div. 2. Все предложенные задачи могут быть решены без условий и циклов. Требуются только формулы. Присваивания и функции могут быть использованы для сокращения дублирования кода.Темы задач: комбинаторика геометрия теория игр последовательности другое Раунд подготовлен как часть комплекса мероприятий Вологодский БИТ, также как часть этих мероприятий проходили вебинары «Олимпиадное программирование с нуля на Java», посвящённые перечисленным выше темам. Записи вебинаров доступны на YouTube (на русском).Раунд был подготовлен мной, Фёдором Меньшиковым mfv, Игорем Андриановым igand и Олегом Стрекаловским OSt. Особая благодарность Марии Беловой Delinur за вычитку и исправление условий на английском и конечно Михаилу Мирзаянову MikeMirzayanov за платформу Codeforces и Полигон. Полигон сделал чекеры и тесты для этого соревнования лучше.UPD: Разбор задач завершён.",

This time the problemset is recommended for Div.2 participants.The round will be unrated for all users and it will be held according to the standard ACM-ICPC rules. You will have 180 minutes (three hours) to solve 18 problems. There will be no open hacks phase after the round.Our main target audience is beginners and Div. 2 members. All offered problems can be solved without conditional constructs and without loops. Only formulas are required. Assignments and functions can be used to reduce code duplication.The topics of the problems are: combinatorics geometry game theory sequences other The round is created as a part of Vologda BIT event, also as part of this event “Contest programming from zero in Java” webinars were held devoted to the topics listed above. Recordings of the webinars are available on YouTube (in Russian).The round was prepared by me, Fyodor Menshikov mfv, Igor Andrianov igand and Oleg Strekalovsky OSt. Special thanks to Maria Belova Delinur for bugfixing the English statements and of course to MikeMirzayanov for Codeforces platform and Polygon.

There is no need to read n.B. Moore's LawEvery second the number is multiplied by 1.000000011. Multiplication several times to the same number is equivalent to exponentiation. So the formula is n·1.000000011t (1.000000011 raised to the power of t and then multiplied to n). In a program one should not use a loop to calculate power as it is too slow for such big n, usually a programming language provides a function for exponentiation such as pow.C. Lucky NumbersThere are 2 lucky numbers of the length 1. They are 7 and 8. There are 4 lucky numbers of the length 2. They are 77, 78, 87 and 88. There are 8 lucky numbers of the length 3. They are 777, 778, 787, 788, 877, 878, 887, 888. For each addition of 1 to the length the number of lucky numbers is increased times 2. It is easy to prove: to any number of the previous length one can append 7 or 8, so one number of the prevous length creates two numbers of the next length.So for the length n the amount of lucky numbers of the length exactly n is 2n. But in the problem we need the amount of lucky numbers of length not greater than n. Let's sum up them. 21 = 2, 21 + 22 = 2 + 4 = 6, 21 + 22 + 23 = 2 + 4 + 8 = 14, 21 + 22 + 23 + 24 = 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 30. One can notice that the sum of all previous powers of two is equal to the next power of two minus the first power of two. So the answer to the problem is 2n + 1 - 2.One of the possible implementations of 2n + 1 in a programming language is to shift 1 bitwise to the left for n + 1 binary digits or to shift 2 bitwise to the left for n binary digits. For example, in Java the problem answer formula is (2L << n) - 2, in C++ is (2LL << n) - 2. Suffixes L and LL correspondingly are required so that result of the shift expression have 64-bit integer type (long in Java and long long in C++). Type of the second operand does not matter for the type of shift expression, only the type of the first operand. Also parenthesis are required because without them subtraction is performed first and only then bitwise shift.D. Hexagons!Let's count the number of cells having the distance of exactly n. For n = 0 it is 1, for n = 1 it is 6, for n = 2 it is 12, for n = 3 it is 18 and so on. One can notice that n = 0 is a special case, and then the amount increases by addition of 6. These numbers form an arithmetic progression. In the problem we need to sum these numbers. The formula of the sum of an arithmetic progression is (first + last)·amount / 2. The first is 6, the last is 6n, the amount is n. So the sum is (6 + 6n)n / 2 = 3(n + 1)n. And plus 1 that is not in the arithmetic progression. So the final formula is 1 + 3n(n + 1).To avoid overflow, multiplication in the formula should be performed in 64-bit integer type. For this either 3 or 1 or n should have 64-bit integer type. The literals are 64-bit integer when they have suffix L in Java or LL in C++.E. A rectangleLet's see how the number of affected cells changes depending on the column. For example 3, 2, 3, 2, 3. That is it alternates between the size of the first column and the size of the first column minus one. The amount of \"minus ones\" is the amount of columns divided by 2 rounded down. Without \"minus ones\" all columns have equal size and the total amount of cells is equal to size of the first column multiplied by the number of the columns. The first column size is (y2 - y1) / 2 + 1. The columns amount is x2 - x1 + 1. So the final formula is ((y2 - y1) / 2 + 1)·(x2 - x1 + 1) - (x2 - x1) / 2.To avoid overflow, multiplication should be computed in 64-bit integer type.F. Selection of PersonnelThe amount of ways to choose a group of 5 people from n candidates is equal to the number of combinations , the amount of ways to choose a group of 6 people from n candidates is , the amount of ways to choose a group of 7 people from n candidates is , the amount of ways to choose a group of 5, 6 or 7 people from n candidates is .To avoid 64-bit integer overflow can be calculated in the following way: n / 1 * (n - 1) / 2 * (n - 2) / 3 * (n - 3) / 4 * (n - 4) / 5 * (n - 5) / 6 * (n - 6) / 7. Each division returns an integer because each prefix of this formula after division is also the number of combinations .G. Challenge PennantsFirst of all, ways to place both types of the pennants are independent. So each way to place \"I fixed a critical bug\" pennants on n tables is compatible to each way to place \"I suggested a new feature\" pennants on n tables. Therefore the answer of the problem is equal to the number of ways to place \"I fixed a critical bug\" pennants multiplied by the number of ways to place \"I suggested a new feature\" pennant.The number of ways to place k identical items into n different places when any place can contain any amount of items is the definition of the number of k-combinations with repetitions or k-multicombinations. The formula for the number is .So the whole formula for the problem is .To avoid overflow of 64-bit integer type recommended formulas for computation are (n + 2) / 1 * (n + 1) / 2 * n / 3 and (n + 4) / 1 * (n + 3) / 2 * (n + 2) / 3 * (n + 1) / 4 * n / 5.H. BenchesThe number of ways to choose 5 east to west paths that will have benches from n is . There are n ways to place a bench on the first of these paths. Given the place of the first bench there are n - 1 ways to place a bench on the second of these paths because one of north to south paths is already taken. Given the places of the first and second benches there are n - 2 ways to place a bench on the third of these paths because two of north to south paths are already taken. And the same way n - 3 and n - 4 for the fourth and the fifth benches. Total number of ways to place benches on selected 5 east to west path is n(n - 1)(n - 2)(n - 3)(n - 4). So the formula for the problem is .To avoid 64-bit integer overflow recommended order of computation is exactly as in the formula above, division should not be the last operation.I. Parking LotThere are the following ways to place n cars of the same make. They can be the first n, the last n, or they can be somewhere in the middle of the parking lot.When n cars of the same make are the first or the last, there are 4 ways to choose the make of these n cars, then there are 3 ways to choose the make of one car adjacent to them (the make should be different from the make of n cars) and there are 4 ways to choose the make of each of the remaining n - 3 cars. So the formula for the case of n cars of the same make on either end of the parking lot is 4·3·4n - 3.When n cars of the same make are situated somewhere in the middle, there are 4 ways to choose the make of these n cars, then there are 3 ways to choose the make of each of two cars adjacent to them (the makes of these two cars should be different from the make of n cars) and there are 4 ways to choose the make of each of the remaining n - 4 cars. So the formula for the case of n cars of the same make on a given position somewhere in the middle of the parking lot is 4·32·4n - 4.There are 2 positions of n cars of the same make in the end of the parking lot and there are n - 3 positions of n cars of the same make somewhere in the middle of the parking lot. So the final formula is 2·4·3·4n - 3 + (n - 3)·4·32·4n - 4.J. DivisibilityLet's factorize numbers from 2 to 10. 2 = 2, 3 = 3, 4 = 22, 5 = 5, 6 = 2·3, 7 = 7, 8 = 23, 9 = 32, 10 = 2·5. If a number is divisible by all numbers from 2 to 10, its factorization should contain 2 at least in the power of 3, 3 at least in the power of 2, 5 and 7 at least in the power of 1. So it can be written as x·23·32·5·7 = x·2520. So any number divisible by 2520 is divisible by all numbers from 2 to 10.There are numbers from 1 to n divisible by all numbers from 2 to 10. In a programming language it is usually implemented as simple integer division.K. IndivisibilityThe amount of numbers from 1 to n not divisible by any number from 2 to 10 is equal to the amount of all numbers from 1 to n (that is n) minus the amount of numbers from 1 to n divisible by some number from 2 to 10.The set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by some number from 2 to 10 can be found as union of the set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by 2, the set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by 3 and so on till 10.Note that sets of numbers divisible by 4 or 6 or 8 are subsets of the set of numbers divisible by 2, and sets of numbers divisible by 6 or 9 are subsets of the set of numbers divisible by 3. So there is no need to unite 9 sets, it is enough to unite sets for 2, 3, 5, 7 only.The size of set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by some of 2, 3, 5, 7 can be calculated using inclusion-exclusion principle that says that size of each single set should be added, size of pairwise intersections should be subtracted, size of all intersections of three sets should be added and so on.The size of set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by 2 is equal to , the size of set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by 2 and 3 is equal to and so on.The final formula is Division with rounding down in the formula in a programming language is usually just integer division.L. Cracking the CodeIn this problem just implementation of the actions described in the statement is required. However there are two catches in this problem.The first catch is that the fifth power of five-digit number cannot be represented by a 64-bit integer. But we need not the fifth power, we need the fifth power modulo 105. And mod operation can be applied after each multiplication (see problem A above).The second catch is that you need to output five digits, not the fifth power modulo 105. The difference is when fifth digit from the end is zero. To output a number with the leading zero one can either use corresponding formatting (%05d in printf) or extract digits and output them one by one.M. TurnFirst of all, let's reduce camera rotation angle to [0, 359] degrees range. It is accomplished by the following C++/Java code: angle = (angle % 360 + 360) % 360;Then there are the following cases: [0, 44] degrees — no need to rotate, 45 degrees — 0 or 1 turn to minimum deviation, minimum is 0, [46, 134] degrees — one turn required, 135 degrees — 1 or 2 turns to minimum deviation, minimum is 1, [136, 224] degrees — two turns required, 225 degrees — 2 or 3 turns to minimum deviation, minimum is 2, [226, 314] degrees — three turns required, 315 degrees — 3 or 0 turns to minimum deviation, minimum is 0, [316, 359] degrees — no need to rotate. Let's add 44 degrees to the angle from the range [0, 359]. C++/Java code is angle = (angle + 44) % 360; Then the ranges will be: [0, 89] degrees — 0 turns, [90, 179] degrees — 1 turn, [180, 269] degrees — 2 turns, [270, 358] degrees — 3 turns, 359 degrees — 0 turns. One special case of 359 degrees can be eliminated by taking angle modulo 359. Then just integer division by 90 is required to get the answer. C++/Java code is answer = (angle % 359) / 90;N. ForecastThere is nothing special in solving a quadratic equation but the problem has one catch. You should output the greater root first.The simplest approach is to output max(x1, x2) first, then min(x1, x2).Another approach is based upon the sign of a. for a > 0 and for a < 0.We can divide all coefficients by a, and then the first coefficient will be positive. But notice that division should be done in a floating point type and a should be divided last otherwise resulting a / a = 1 would not be able to divide b and c.O. ArrowTo get a vector of the given length b in the direction of the given vector (vx, vy) it is just required to normalize the given vector (divide it by its length) and then multiply by b.Let's denote , vnx = vx / len, vny = vy / len. Then (vnx, vny) is the normalized vector, and the first point of the arrow is (px + vnx·b, py + vny·b).To get the second point of the arrow one needs to rotate the normalized vector 90 degrees counter-clockwise and then multiply by the half of the triangle base a / 2. Let's denote vlx =  - vny, vly = vnx. Then (vlx, vly) is the normalized vector 90 degrees counter-clockwise to (vnx, vny). So the second point of the arrow is (px + vlx·a / 2, py + vly·a / 2).The third point can be found the same way as the second point but the length of the vector to it is c / 2. So the third point of the arrow is (px + vlx·c / 2, py + vly·c / 2).The fourth point can be found by adding the vector of the length c / 2 to the left of the given and the vector of the length d reverse to the given. So the fourth point of the arrow is (px + vlx·c / 2 - vnx·d, py + vly·c / 2 - vny·d).The remaining points are symmetrical to the points discussed above so they can be obtained the same way, just using minus for (vlx, vly) instead of plus. So the next points are (px - vlx·c / 2 - vnx·d, py - vly·c / 2 - vny·d), (px - vlx·c / 2, py - vly·c / 2), (px - vlx·a / 2, py - vly·a / 2).P. Area of a Star where n in the number of the star corners because in a regular star all angles between corners are equal. because of symmetry. because it is an inscribed angle. because of symmetry.So we know OA = r and and . We can calculate the area of AOB triangle knowing the length of a side and two angles adjacent to it using formula .The whole star area is equal to 2n areas of AOB triangle because of symmetry. .Q. PyramidsThe volume of a pyramid can be calculated as where v is the volume, s is the area of the base and h is the height from the base to the apex. Let's calculate s and h.The area of a regular polygon having n sides of length ln can be found the following way.On the figure above a regular polygon is shown. O is the center of the polygon, all sides are equal to ln, OB is the altitude of AOC triangle. As the polygon is a regular one OA = OC, AOC triangle is a isosceles one and then and AB = BC, also AOB and COB triangles are right-angled ones. Also because the polygon is a regular one and can be seen as a union of 2n triangles equal to AOB triangle then .AOB triangle is right-angled one, so , . Also . So and . The area of AOB is equal to . The area of the polygon is .On the figure above a triangle formed by the pyramid apex H, the center of the base O and some vertex of the base A is shown. It is a right-angled one. As all edges of the pyramid are equal, AH = ln and from calculations above . According to Pythagorean theorem OA2 + OH2 = AH2. So .The volume of one piramid is .And the final formula is .R. GameFor the field of an even size there is a winning strategy for the second player. Namely, to paint a cell that is symmetrical with respect to the center of the field to the cell painted by the first player on the previous turn. After each turn of the second player the field is centrosymmetrical and so there is always a cell that can be painted that is symmetrical with respect to the center of the field to any cell that the first player can choose to paint. .... 1... .1.. .... ....\n.... .... .... 1... .1..\n.... .... .... ...2 ..2.\n.... ...2 ..2. .... ....For the field of an odd size there is a winning strategy for the first player. Namely, on the first turn to paint the central cell, then to paint a cell that is symmetrical with respect to the center of the field to the cell painted by the second player on the previous turn. After each turn of the first player the field is centrosymmetrical and so there is always a cell that can be painted that is symmetrical with respect to the center of the field to any cell that the second player can choose to paint. ..... 2.... .2... ..2.. .....\n..... ..... ..... ..... .2...\n..1.. ..1.. ..1.. ..1.. ..1..\n..... ..... ..... ..... ...1.\n..... ....1 ...1. ..1.. .....So for even n the answer is 2, for odd n the answer is 1. One of the possible formulas for the problem is .n can be up to 1018 so at least 64-bit integer type should be used to input it.",

          "content": "A. Again Twenty Five!The problem of getting the last two digits is equivalent to the problem of getting the number modulo 100. So we need to calculate . According to the rules of modular arithmeticSoLet's note that 52 = 25. ThenAnd so on. All are equal to 25 for all n ≥ 2.So to solve the problem one need to just output 25. There is no need to read n.B. Moore's LawEvery second the number is multiplied by 1.000000011. Multiplication several times to the same number is equivalent to exponentiation. So the formula is n·1.000000011t (1.000000011 raised to the power of t and then multiplied to n). In a program one should not use a loop to calculate power as it is too slow for such big n, usually a programming language provides a function for exponentiation such as pow.C. Lucky NumbersThere are 2 lucky numbers of the length 1. They are 7 and 8. There are 4 lucky numbers of the length 2. They are 77, 78, 87 and 88. There are 8 lucky numbers of the length 3. They are 777, 778, 787, 788, 877, 878, 887, 888. For each addition of 1 to the length the number of lucky numbers is increased times 2. It is easy to prove: to any number of the previous length one can append 7 or 8, so one number of the prevous length creates two numbers of the next length.So for the length n the amount of lucky numbers of the length exactly n is 2n. But in the problem we need the amount of lucky numbers of length not greater than n. Let's sum up them. 21 = 2, 21 + 22 = 2 + 4 = 6, 21 + 22 + 23 = 2 + 4 + 8 = 14, 21 + 22 + 23 + 24 = 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 30. One can notice that the sum of all previous powers of two is equal to the next power of two minus the first power of two. So the answer to the problem is 2n + 1 - 2.One of the possible implementations of 2n + 1 in a programming language is to shift 1 bitwise to the left for n + 1 binary digits or to shift 2 bitwise to the left for n binary digits. For example, in Java the problem answer formula is (2L << n) - 2, in C++ is (2LL << n) - 2. Suffixes L and LL correspondingly are required so that result of the shift expression have 64-bit integer type (long in Java and long long in C++). Type of the second operand does not matter for the type of shift expression, only the type of the first operand. Also parenthesis are required because without them subtraction is performed first and only then bitwise shift.D. Hexagons!Let's count the number of cells having the distance of exactly n. For n = 0 it is 1, for n = 1 it is 6, for n = 2 it is 12, for n = 3 it is 18 and so on. One can notice that n = 0 is a special case, and then the amount increases by addition of 6. These numbers form an arithmetic progression. In the problem we need to sum these numbers. The formula of the sum of an arithmetic progression is (first + last)·amount / 2. The first is 6, the last is 6n, the amount is n. So the sum is (6 + 6n)n / 2 = 3(n + 1)n. And plus 1 that is not in the arithmetic progression. So the final formula is 1 + 3n(n + 1).To avoid overflow, multiplication in the formula should be performed in 64-bit integer type. For this either 3 or 1 or n should have 64-bit integer type. The literals are 64-bit integer when they have suffix L in Java or LL in C++.E. A rectangleLet's see how the number of affected cells changes depending on the column. For example 3, 2, 3, 2, 3. That is it alternates between the size of the first column and the size of the first column minus one. The amount of \"minus ones\" is the amount of columns divided by 2 rounded down. Without \"minus ones\" all columns have equal size and the total amount of cells is equal to size of the first column multiplied by the number of the columns. The first column size is (y2 - y1) / 2 + 1. The columns amount is x2 - x1 + 1. So the final formula is ((y2 - y1) / 2 + 1)·(x2 - x1 + 1) - (x2 - x1) / 2.To avoid overflow, multiplication should be computed in 64-bit integer type.F. Selection of PersonnelThe amount of ways to choose a group of 5 people from n candidates is equal to the number of combinations , the amount of ways to choose a group of 6 people from n candidates is , the amount of ways to choose a group of 7 people from n candidates is , the amount of ways to choose a group of 5, 6 or 7 people from n candidates is .To avoid 64-bit integer overflow can be calculated in the following way: n / 1 * (n - 1) / 2 * (n - 2) / 3 * (n - 3) / 4 * (n - 4) / 5 * (n - 5) / 6 * (n - 6) / 7. Each division returns an integer because each prefix of this formula after division is also the number of combinations .G. Challenge PennantsFirst of all, ways to place both types of the pennants are independent. So each way to place \"I fixed a critical bug\" pennants on n tables is compatible to each way to place \"I suggested a new feature\" pennants on n tables. Therefore the answer of the problem is equal to the number of ways to place \"I fixed a critical bug\" pennants multiplied by the number of ways to place \"I suggested a new feature\" pennant.The number of ways to place k identical items into n different places when any place can contain any amount of items is the definition of the number of k-combinations with repetitions or k-multicombinations. The formula for the number is .So the whole formula for the problem is .To avoid overflow of 64-bit integer type recommended formulas for computation are (n + 2) / 1 * (n + 1) / 2 * n / 3 and (n + 4) / 1 * (n + 3) / 2 * (n + 2) / 3 * (n + 1) / 4 * n / 5.H. BenchesThe number of ways to choose 5 east to west paths that will have benches from n is . There are n ways to place a bench on the first of these paths. Given the place of the first bench there are n - 1 ways to place a bench on the second of these paths because one of north to south paths is already taken. Given the places of the first and second benches there are n - 2 ways to place a bench on the third of these paths because two of north to south paths are already taken. And the same way n - 3 and n - 4 for the fourth and the fifth benches. Total number of ways to place benches on selected 5 east to west path is n(n - 1)(n - 2)(n - 3)(n - 4). So the formula for the problem is .To avoid 64-bit integer overflow recommended order of computation is exactly as in the formula above, division should not be the last operation.I. Parking LotThere are the following ways to place n cars of the same make. They can be the first n, the last n, or they can be somewhere in the middle of the parking lot.When n cars of the same make are the first or the last, there are 4 ways to choose the make of these n cars, then there are 3 ways to choose the make of one car adjacent to them (the make should be different from the make of n cars) and there are 4 ways to choose the make of each of the remaining n - 3 cars. So the formula for the case of n cars of the same make on either end of the parking lot is 4·3·4n - 3.When n cars of the same make are situated somewhere in the middle, there are 4 ways to choose the make of these n cars, then there are 3 ways to choose the make of each of two cars adjacent to them (the makes of these two cars should be different from the make of n cars) and there are 4 ways to choose the make of each of the remaining n - 4 cars. So the formula for the case of n cars of the same make on a given position somewhere in the middle of the parking lot is 4·32·4n - 4.There are 2 positions of n cars of the same make in the end of the parking lot and there are n - 3 positions of n cars of the same make somewhere in the middle of the parking lot. So the final formula is 2·4·3·4n - 3 + (n - 3)·4·32·4n - 4.J. DivisibilityLet's factorize numbers from 2 to 10. 2 = 2, 3 = 3, 4 = 22, 5 = 5, 6 = 2·3, 7 = 7, 8 = 23, 9 = 32, 10 = 2·5. If a number is divisible by all numbers from 2 to 10, its factorization should contain 2 at least in the power of 3, 3 at least in the power of 2, 5 and 7 at least in the power of 1. So it can be written as x·23·32·5·7 = x·2520. So any number divisible by 2520 is divisible by all numbers from 2 to 10.There are numbers from 1 to n divisible by all numbers from 2 to 10. In a programming language it is usually implemented as simple integer division.K. IndivisibilityThe amount of numbers from 1 to n not divisible by any number from 2 to 10 is equal to the amount of all numbers from 1 to n (that is n) minus the amount of numbers from 1 to n divisible by some number from 2 to 10.The set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by some number from 2 to 10 can be found as union of the set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by 2, the set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by 3 and so on till 10.Note that sets of numbers divisible by 4 or 6 or 8 are subsets of the set of numbers divisible by 2, and sets of numbers divisible by 6 or 9 are subsets of the set of numbers divisible by 3. So there is no need to unite 9 sets, it is enough to unite sets for 2, 3, 5, 7 only.The size of set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by some of 2, 3, 5, 7 can be calculated using inclusion-exclusion principle that says that size of each single set should be added, size of pairwise intersections should be subtracted, size of all intersections of three sets should be added and so on.The size of set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by 2 is equal to , the size of set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by 2 and 3 is equal to and so on.The final formula is Division with rounding down in the formula in a programming language is usually just integer division.L. Cracking the CodeIn this problem just implementation of the actions described in the statement is required. However there are two catches in this problem.The first catch is that the fifth power of five-digit number cannot be represented by a 64-bit integer. But we need not the fifth power, we need the fifth power modulo 105. And mod operation can be applied after each multiplication (see problem A above).The second catch is that you need to output five digits, not the fifth power modulo 105. The difference is when fifth digit from the end is zero. To output a number with the leading zero one can either use corresponding formatting (%05d in printf) or extract digits and output them one by one.M. TurnFirst of all, let's reduce camera rotation angle to [0, 359] degrees range. It is accomplished by the following C++/Java code: angle = (angle % 360 + 360) % 360;Then there are the following cases: [0, 44] degrees — no need to rotate, 45 degrees — 0 or 1 turn to minimum deviation, minimum is 0, [46, 134] degrees — one turn required, 135 degrees — 1 or 2 turns to minimum deviation, minimum is 1, [136, 224] degrees — two turns required, 225 degrees — 2 or 3 turns to minimum deviation, minimum is 2, [226, 314] degrees — three turns required, 315 degrees — 3 or 0 turns to minimum deviation, minimum is 0, [316, 359] degrees — no need to rotate. Let's add 44 degrees to the angle from the range [0, 359]. C++/Java code is angle = (angle + 44) % 360; Then the ranges will be: [0, 89] degrees — 0 turns, [90, 179] degrees — 1 turn, [180, 269] degrees — 2 turns, [270, 358] degrees — 3 turns, 359 degrees — 0 turns. One special case of 359 degrees can be eliminated by taking angle modulo 359. Then just integer division by 90 is required to get the answer. C++/Java code is answer = (angle % 359) / 90;N. ForecastThere is nothing special in solving a quadratic equation but the problem has one catch. You should output the greater root first.The simplest approach is to output max(x1, x2) first, then min(x1, x2).Another approach is based upon the sign of a. for a > 0 and for a < 0.We can divide all coefficients by a, and then the first coefficient will be positive. But notice that division should be done in a floating point type and a should be divided last otherwise resulting a / a = 1 would not be able to divide b and c.O. ArrowTo get a vector of the given length b in the direction of the given vector (vx, vy) it is just required to normalize the given vector (divide it by its length) and then multiply by b.Let's denote , vnx = vx / len, vny = vy / len. Then (vnx, vny) is the normalized vector, and the first point of the arrow is (px + vnx·b, py + vny·b).To get the second point of the arrow one needs to rotate the normalized vector 90 degrees counter-clockwise and then multiply by the half of the triangle base a / 2. Let's denote vlx =  - vny, vly = vnx. Then (vlx, vly) is the normalized vector 90 degrees counter-clockwise to (vnx, vny). So the second point of the arrow is (px + vlx·a / 2, py + vly·a / 2).The third point can be found the same way as the second point but the length of the vector to it is c / 2. So the third point of the arrow is (px + vlx·c / 2, py + vly·c / 2).The fourth point can be found by adding the vector of the length c / 2 to the left of the given and the vector of the length d reverse to the given. So the fourth point of the arrow is (px + vlx·c / 2 - vnx·d, py + vly·c / 2 - vny·d).The remaining points are symmetrical to the points discussed above so they can be obtained the same way, just using minus for (vlx, vly) instead of plus. So the next points are (px - vlx·c / 2 - vnx·d, py - vly·c / 2 - vny·d), (px - vlx·c / 2, py - vly·c / 2), (px - vlx·a / 2, py - vly·a / 2).P. Area of a Star where n in the number of the star corners because in a regular star all angles between corners are equal. because of symmetry. because it is an inscribed angle. because of symmetry.So we know OA = r and and . We can calculate the area of AOB triangle knowing the length of a side and two angles adjacent to it using formula .The whole star area is equal to 2n areas of AOB triangle because of symmetry. .Q. PyramidsThe volume of a pyramid can be calculated as where v is the volume, s is the area of the base and h is the height from the base to the apex. Let's calculate s and h.The area of a regular polygon having n sides of length ln can be found the following way.On the figure above a regular polygon is shown. O is the center of the polygon, all sides are equal to ln, OB is the altitude of AOC triangle. As the polygon is a regular one OA = OC, AOC triangle is a isosceles one and then and AB = BC, also AOB and COB triangles are right-angled ones. Also because the polygon is a regular one and can be seen as a union of 2n triangles equal to AOB triangle then .AOB triangle is right-angled one, so , . Also . So and . The area of AOB is equal to . The area of the polygon is .On the figure above a triangle formed by the pyramid apex H, the center of the base O and some vertex of the base A is shown. It is a right-angled one. As all edges of the pyramid are equal, AH = ln and from calculations above . According to Pythagorean theorem OA2 + OH2 = AH2. So .The volume of one piramid is .And the final formula is .R. GameFor the field of an even size there is a winning strategy for the second player. Namely, to paint a cell that is symmetrical with respect to the center of the field to the cell painted by the first player on the previous turn. After each turn of the second player the field is centrosymmetrical and so there is always a cell that can be painted that is symmetrical with respect to the center of the field to any cell that the first player can choose to paint. .... 1... .1.. .... ....\n.... .... .... 1... .1..\n.... .... .... ...2 ..2.\n.... ...2 ..2. .... ....For the field of an odd size there is a winning strategy for the first player. Namely, on the first turn to paint the central cell, then to paint a cell that is symmetrical with respect to the center of the field to the cell painted by the second player on the previous turn. After each turn of the first player the field is centrosymmetrical and so there is always a cell that can be painted that is symmetrical with respect to the center of the field to any cell that the second player can choose to paint. ..... 2.... .2... ..2.. .....\n..... ..... ..... ..... .2...\n..1.. ..1.. ..1.. ..1.. ..1..\n..... ..... ..... ..... ...1.\n..... ....1 ...1. ..1.. .....So for even n the answer is 2, for odd n the answer is 1. One of the possible formulas for the problem is .n can be up to 1018 so at least 64-bit integer type should be used to input it.",

          "content": "A. Again Twenty Five!The problem of getting the last two digits is equivalent to the problem of getting the number modulo 100. So we need to calculate . According to the rules of modular arithmeticSoLet's note that 52 = 25. ThenAnd so on. All are equal to 25 for all n ≥ 2.So to solve the problem one need to just output 25. There is no need to read n.B. Moore's LawEvery second the number is multiplied by 1.000000011. Multiplication several times to the same number is equivalent to exponentiation. So the formula is n·1.000000011t (1.000000011 raised to the power of t and then multiplied to n). In a program one should not use a loop to calculate power as it is too slow for such big n, usually a programming language provides a function for exponentiation such as pow.C. Lucky NumbersThere are 2 lucky numbers of the length 1. They are 7 and 8. There are 4 lucky numbers of the length 2. They are 77, 78, 87 and 88. There are 8 lucky numbers of the length 3. They are 777, 778, 787, 788, 877, 878, 887, 888. For each addition of 1 to the length the number of lucky numbers is increased times 2. It is easy to prove: to any number of the previous length one can append 7 or 8, so one number of the prevous length creates two numbers of the next length.So for the length n the amount of lucky numbers of the length exactly n is 2n. But in the problem we need the amount of lucky numbers of length not greater than n. Let's sum up them. 21 = 2, 21 + 22 = 2 + 4 = 6, 21 + 22 + 23 = 2 + 4 + 8 = 14, 21 + 22 + 23 + 24 = 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 30. One can notice that the sum of all previous powers of two is equal to the next power of two minus the first power of two. So the answer to the problem is 2n + 1 - 2.One of the possible implementations of 2n + 1 in a programming language is to shift 1 bitwise to the left for n + 1 binary digits or to shift 2 bitwise to the left for n binary digits. For example, in Java the problem answer formula is (2L << n) - 2, in C++ is (2LL << n) - 2. Suffixes L and LL correspondingly are required so that result of the shift expression have 64-bit integer type (long in Java and long long in C++). Type of the second operand does not matter for the type of shift expression, only the type of the first operand. Also parenthesis are required because without them subtraction is performed first and only then bitwise shift.D. Hexagons!Let's count the number of cells having the distance of exactly n. For n = 0 it is 1, for n = 1 it is 6, for n = 2 it is 12, for n = 3 it is 18 and so on. One can notice that n = 0 is a special case, and then the amount increases by addition of 6. These numbers form an arithmetic progression. In the problem we need to sum these numbers. The formula of the sum of an arithmetic progression is (first + last)·amount / 2. The first is 6, the last is 6n, the amount is n. So the sum is (6 + 6n)n / 2 = 3(n + 1)n. And plus 1 that is not in the arithmetic progression. So the final formula is 1 + 3n(n + 1).To avoid overflow, multiplication in the formula should be performed in 64-bit integer type. For this either 3 or 1 or n should have 64-bit integer type. The literals are 64-bit integer when they have suffix L in Java or LL in C++.E. A rectangleLet's see how the number of affected cells changes depending on the column. For example 3, 2, 3, 2, 3. That is it alternates between the size of the first column and the size of the first column minus one. The amount of \"minus ones\" is the amount of columns divided by 2 rounded down. Without \"minus ones\" all columns have equal size and the total amount of cells is equal to size of the first column multiplied by the number of the columns. The first column size is (y2 - y1) / 2 + 1. The columns amount is x2 - x1 + 1. So the final formula is ((y2 - y1) / 2 + 1)·(x2 - x1 + 1) - (x2 - x1) / 2.To avoid overflow, multiplication should be computed in 64-bit integer type.F. Selection of PersonnelThe amount of ways to choose a group of 5 people from n candidates is equal to the number of combinations , the amount of ways to choose a group of 6 people from n candidates is , the amount of ways to choose a group of 7 people from n candidates is , the amount of ways to choose a group of 5, 6 or 7 people from n candidates is .To avoid 64-bit integer overflow can be calculated in the following way: n / 1 * (n - 1) / 2 * (n - 2) / 3 * (n - 3) / 4 * (n - 4) / 5 * (n - 5) / 6 * (n - 6) / 7. Each division returns an integer because each prefix of this formula after division is also the number of combinations .G. Challenge PennantsFirst of all, ways to place both types of the pennants are independent. So each way to place \"I fixed a critical bug\" pennants on n tables is compatible to each way to place \"I suggested a new feature\" pennants on n tables. Therefore the answer of the problem is equal to the number of ways to place \"I fixed a critical bug\" pennants multiplied by the number of ways to place \"I suggested a new feature\" pennant.The number of ways to place k identical items into n different places when any place can contain any amount of items is the definition of the number of k-combinations with repetitions or k-multicombinations. The formula for the number is .So the whole formula for the problem is .To avoid overflow of 64-bit integer type recommended formulas for computation are (n + 2) / 1 * (n + 1) / 2 * n / 3 and (n + 4) / 1 * (n + 3) / 2 * (n + 2) / 3 * (n + 1) / 4 * n / 5.H. BenchesThe number of ways to choose 5 east to west paths that will have benches from n is . There are n ways to place a bench on the first of these paths. Given the place of the first bench there are n - 1 ways to place a bench on the second of these paths because one of north to south paths is already taken. Given the places of the first and second benches there are n - 2 ways to place a bench on the third of these paths because two of north to south paths are already taken. And the same way n - 3 and n - 4 for the fourth and the fifth benches. Total number of ways to place benches on selected 5 east to west path is n(n - 1)(n - 2)(n - 3)(n - 4). So the formula for the problem is .To avoid 64-bit integer overflow recommended order of computation is exactly as in the formula above, division should not be the last operation.I. Parking LotThere are the following ways to place n cars of the same make. They can be the first n, the last n, or they can be somewhere in the middle of the parking lot.When n cars of the same make are the first or the last, there are 4 ways to choose the make of these n cars, then there are 3 ways to choose the make of one car adjacent to them (the make should be different from the make of n cars) and there are 4 ways to choose the make of each of the remaining n - 3 cars. So the formula for the case of n cars of the same make on either end of the parking lot is 4·3·4n - 3.When n cars of the same make are situated somewhere in the middle, there are 4 ways to choose the make of these n cars, then there are 3 ways to choose the make of each of two cars adjacent to them (the makes of these two cars should be different from the make of n cars) and there are 4 ways to choose the make of each of the remaining n - 4 cars. So the formula for the case of n cars of the same make on a given position somewhere in the middle of the parking lot is 4·32·4n - 4.There are 2 positions of n cars of the same make in the end of the parking lot and there are n - 3 positions of n cars of the same make somewhere in the middle of the parking lot. So the final formula is 2·4·3·4n - 3 + (n - 3)·4·32·4n - 4.J. DivisibilityLet's factorize numbers from 2 to 10. 2 = 2, 3 = 3, 4 = 22, 5 = 5, 6 = 2·3, 7 = 7, 8 = 23, 9 = 32, 10 = 2·5. If a number is divisible by all numbers from 2 to 10, its factorization should contain 2 at least in the power of 3, 3 at least in the power of 2, 5 and 7 at least in the power of 1. So it can be written as x·23·32·5·7 = x·2520. So any number divisible by 2520 is divisible by all numbers from 2 to 10.There are numbers from 1 to n divisible by all numbers from 2 to 10. In a programming language it is usually implemented as simple integer division.K. IndivisibilityThe amount of numbers from 1 to n not divisible by any number from 2 to 10 is equal to the amount of all numbers from 1 to n (that is n) minus the amount of numbers from 1 to n divisible by some number from 2 to 10.The set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by some number from 2 to 10 can be found as union of the set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by 2, the set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by 3 and so on till 10.Note that sets of numbers divisible by 4 or 6 or 8 are subsets of the set of numbers divisible by 2, and sets of numbers divisible by 6 or 9 are subsets of the set of numbers divisible by 3. So there is no need to unite 9 sets, it is enough to unite sets for 2, 3, 5, 7 only.The size of set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by some of 2, 3, 5, 7 can be calculated using inclusion-exclusion principle that says that size of each single set should be added, size of pairwise intersections should be subtracted, size of all intersections of three sets should be added and so on.The size of set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by 2 is equal to , the size of set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by 2 and 3 is equal to and so on.The final formula is Division with rounding down in the formula in a programming language is usually just integer division.L. Cracking the CodeIn this problem just implementation of the actions described in the statement is required. However there are two catches in this problem.The first catch is that the fifth power of five-digit number cannot be represented by a 64-bit integer. But we need not the fifth power, we need the fifth power modulo 105. And mod operation can be applied after each multiplication (see problem A above).The second catch is that you need to output five digits, not the fifth power modulo 105. The difference is when fifth digit from the end is zero. To output a number with the leading zero one can either use corresponding formatting (%05d in printf) or extract digits and output them one by one.M. TurnFirst of all, let's reduce camera rotation angle to [0, 359] degrees range. It is accomplished by the following C++/Java code: angle = (angle % 360 + 360) % 360;Then there are the following cases: [0, 44] degrees — no need to rotate, 45 degrees — 0 or 1 turn to minimum deviation, minimum is 0, [46, 134] degrees — one turn required, 135 degrees — 1 or 2 turns to minimum deviation, minimum is 1, [136, 224] degrees — two turns required, 225 degrees — 2 or 3 turns to minimum deviation, minimum is 2, [226, 314] degrees — three turns required, 315 degrees — 3 or 0 turns to minimum deviation, minimum is 0, [316, 359] degrees — no need to rotate. Let's add 44 degrees to the angle from the range [0, 359]. C++/Java code is angle = (angle + 44) % 360; Then the ranges will be: [0, 89] degrees — 0 turns, [90, 179] degrees — 1 turn, [180, 269] degrees — 2 turns, [270, 358] degrees — 3 turns, 359 degrees — 0 turns. One special case of 359 degrees can be eliminated by taking angle modulo 359. Then just integer division by 90 is required to get the answer. C++/Java code is answer = (angle % 359) / 90;N. ForecastThere is nothing special in solving a quadratic equation but the problem has one catch. You should output the greater root first.The simplest approach is to output max(x1, x2) first, then min(x1, x2).Another approach is based upon the sign of a. for a > 0 and for a < 0.We can divide all coefficients by a, and then the first coefficient will be positive. But notice that division should be done in a floating point type and a should be divided last otherwise resulting a / a = 1 would not be able to divide b and c.O. ArrowTo get a vector of the given length b in the direction of the given vector (vx, vy) it is just required to normalize the given vector (divide it by its length) and then multiply by b.Let's denote , vnx = vx / len, vny = vy / len. Then (vnx, vny) is the normalized vector, and the first point of the arrow is (px + vnx·b, py + vny·b).To get the second point of the arrow one needs to rotate the normalized vector 90 degrees counter-clockwise and then multiply by the half of the triangle base a / 2. Let's denote vlx =  - vny, vly = vnx. Then (vlx, vly) is the normalized vector 90 degrees counter-clockwise to (vnx, vny). So the second point of the arrow is (px + vlx·a / 2, py + vly·a / 2).The third point can be found the same way as the second point but the length of the vector to it is c / 2. So the third point of the arrow is (px + vlx·c / 2, py + vly·c / 2).The fourth point can be found by adding the vector of the length c / 2 to the left of the given and the vector of the length d reverse to the given. So the fourth point of the arrow is (px + vlx·c / 2 - vnx·d, py + vly·c / 2 - vny·d).The remaining points are symmetrical to the points discussed above so they can be obtained the same way, just using minus for (vlx, vly) instead of plus. So the next points are (px - vlx·c / 2 - vnx·d, py - vly·c / 2 - vny·d), (px - vlx·c / 2, py - vly·c / 2), (px - vlx·a / 2, py - vly·a / 2).P. Area of a Star where n in the number of the star corners because in a regular star all angles between corners are equal. because of symmetry. because it is an inscribed angle. because of symmetry.So we know OA = r and and . We can calculate the area of AOB triangle knowing the length of a side and two angles adjacent to it using formula .The whole star area is equal to 2n areas of AOB triangle because of symmetry. .Q. PyramidsThe volume of a pyramid can be calculated as where v is the volume, s is the area of the base and h is the height from the base to the apex. Let's calculate s and h.The area of a regular polygon having n sides of length ln can be found the following way.On the figure above a regular polygon is shown. O is the center of the polygon, all sides are equal to ln, OB is the altitude of AOC triangle. As the polygon is a regular one OA = OC, AOC triangle is a isosceles one and then and AB = BC, also AOB and COB triangles are right-angled ones. Also because the polygon is a regular one and can be seen as a union of 2n triangles equal to AOB triangle then .AOB triangle is right-angled one, so , . Also . So and . The area of AOB is equal to . The area of the polygon is .On the figure above a triangle formed by the pyramid apex H, the center of the base O and some vertex of the base A is shown. It is a right-angled one. As all edges of the pyramid are equal, AH = ln and from calculations above . According to Pythagorean theorem OA2 + OH2 = AH2. So .The volume of one piramid is .And the final formula is .R. GameFor the field of an even size there is a winning strategy for the second player. Namely, to paint a cell that is symmetrical with respect to the center of the field to the cell painted by the first player on the previous turn. After each turn of the second player the field is centrosymmetrical and so there is always a cell that can be painted that is symmetrical with respect to the center of the field to any cell that the first player can choose to paint. .... 1... .1.. .... ....\n.... .... .... 1... .1..\n.... .... .... ...2 ..2.\n.... ...2 ..2. .... ....For the field of an odd size there is a winning strategy for the first player. Namely, on the first turn to paint the central cell, then to paint a cell that is symmetrical with respect to the center of the field to the cell painted by the second player on the previous turn. After each turn of the first player the field is centrosymmetrical and so there is always a cell that can be painted that is symmetrical with respect to the center of the field to any cell that the second player can choose to paint. ..... 2.... .2... ..2.. .....\n..... ..... ..... ..... .2...\n..1.. ..1.. ..1.. ..1.. ..1..\n..... ..... ..... ..... ...1.\n..... ....1 ...1. ..1.. .....So for even n the answer is 2, for odd n the answer is 1. One of the possible formulas for the problem is .n can be up to 1018 so at least 64-bit integer type should be used to input it.",

          "content": "A. Again Twenty Five!The problem of getting the last two digits is equivalent to the problem of getting the number modulo 100. So we need to calculate . According to the rules of modular arithmeticSoLet's note that 52 = 25. ThenAnd so on. All are equal to 25 for all n ≥ 2.So to solve the problem one need to just output 25. There is no need to read n.B. Moore's LawEvery second the number is multiplied by 1.000000011. Multiplication several times to the same number is equivalent to exponentiation. So the formula is n·1.000000011t (1.000000011 raised to the power of t and then multiplied to n). In a program one should not use a loop to calculate power as it is too slow for such big n, usually a programming language provides a function for exponentiation such as pow.C. Lucky NumbersThere are 2 lucky numbers of the length 1. They are 7 and 8. There are 4 lucky numbers of the length 2. They are 77, 78, 87 and 88. There are 8 lucky numbers of the length 3. They are 777, 778, 787, 788, 877, 878, 887, 888. For each addition of 1 to the length the number of lucky numbers is increased times 2. It is easy to prove: to any number of the previous length one can append 7 or 8, so one number of the prevous length creates two numbers of the next length.So for the length n the amount of lucky numbers of the length exactly n is 2n. But in the problem we need the amount of lucky numbers of length not greater than n. Let's sum up them. 21 = 2, 21 + 22 = 2 + 4 = 6, 21 + 22 + 23 = 2 + 4 + 8 = 14, 21 + 22 + 23 + 24 = 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 30. One can notice that the sum of all previous powers of two is equal to the next power of two minus the first power of two. So the answer to the problem is 2n + 1 - 2.One of the possible implementations of 2n + 1 in a programming language is to shift 1 bitwise to the left for n + 1 binary digits or to shift 2 bitwise to the left for n binary digits. For example, in Java the problem answer formula is (2L << n) - 2, in C++ is (2LL << n) - 2. Suffixes L and LL correspondingly are required so that result of the shift expression have 64-bit integer type (long in Java and long long in C++). Type of the second operand does not matter for the type of shift expression, only the type of the first operand. Also parenthesis are required because without them subtraction is performed first and only then bitwise shift.D. Hexagons!Let's count the number of cells having the distance of exactly n. For n = 0 it is 1, for n = 1 it is 6, for n = 2 it is 12, for n = 3 it is 18 and so on. One can notice that n = 0 is a special case, and then the amount increases by addition of 6. These numbers form an arithmetic progression. In the problem we need to sum these numbers. The formula of the sum of an arithmetic progression is (first + last)·amount / 2. The first is 6, the last is 6n, the amount is n. So the sum is (6 + 6n)n / 2 = 3(n + 1)n. And plus 1 that is not in the arithmetic progression. So the final formula is 1 + 3n(n + 1).To avoid overflow, multiplication in the formula should be performed in 64-bit integer type. For this either 3 or 1 or n should have 64-bit integer type. The literals are 64-bit integer when they have suffix L in Java or LL in C++.E. A rectangleLet's see how the number of affected cells changes depending on the column. For example 3, 2, 3, 2, 3. That is it alternates between the size of the first column and the size of the first column minus one. The amount of \"minus ones\" is the amount of columns divided by 2 rounded down. Without \"minus ones\" all columns have equal size and the total amount of cells is equal to size of the first column multiplied by the number of the columns. The first column size is (y2 - y1) / 2 + 1. The columns amount is x2 - x1 + 1. So the final formula is ((y2 - y1) / 2 + 1)·(x2 - x1 + 1) - (x2 - x1) / 2.To avoid overflow, multiplication should be computed in 64-bit integer type.F. Selection of PersonnelThe amount of ways to choose a group of 5 people from n candidates is equal to the number of combinations , the amount of ways to choose a group of 6 people from n candidates is , the amount of ways to choose a group of 7 people from n candidates is , the amount of ways to choose a group of 5, 6 or 7 people from n candidates is .To avoid 64-bit integer overflow can be calculated in the following way: n / 1 * (n - 1) / 2 * (n - 2) / 3 * (n - 3) / 4 * (n - 4) / 5 * (n - 5) / 6 * (n - 6) / 7. Each division returns an integer because each prefix of this formula after division is also the number of combinations .G. Challenge PennantsFirst of all, ways to place both types of the pennants are independent. So each way to place \"I fixed a critical bug\" pennants on n tables is compatible to each way to place \"I suggested a new feature\" pennants on n tables. Therefore the answer of the problem is equal to the number of ways to place \"I fixed a critical bug\" pennants multiplied by the number of ways to place \"I suggested a new feature\" pennant.The number of ways to place k identical items into n different places when any place can contain any amount of items is the definition of the number of k-combinations with repetitions or k-multicombinations. The formula for the number is .So the whole formula for the problem is .To avoid overflow of 64-bit integer type recommended formulas for computation are (n + 2) / 1 * (n + 1) / 2 * n / 3 and (n + 4) / 1 * (n + 3) / 2 * (n + 2) / 3 * (n + 1) / 4 * n / 5.H. BenchesThe number of ways to choose 5 east to west paths that will have benches from n is . There are n ways to place a bench on the first of these paths. Given the place of the first bench there are n - 1 ways to place a bench on the second of these paths because one of north to south paths is already taken. Given the places of the first and second benches there are n - 2 ways to place a bench on the third of these paths because two of north to south paths are already taken. And the same way n - 3 and n - 4 for the fourth and the fifth benches. Total number of ways to place benches on selected 5 east to west path is n(n - 1)(n - 2)(n - 3)(n - 4). So the formula for the problem is .To avoid 64-bit integer overflow recommended order of computation is exactly as in the formula above, division should not be the last operation.I. Parking LotThere are the following ways to place n cars of the same make. They can be the first n, the last n, or they can be somewhere in the middle of the parking lot.When n cars of the same make are the first or the last, there are 4 ways to choose the make of these n cars, then there are 3 ways to choose the make of one car adjacent to them (the make should be different from the make of n cars) and there are 4 ways to choose the make of each of the remaining n - 3 cars. So the formula for the case of n cars of the same make on either end of the parking lot is 4·3·4n - 3.When n cars of the same make are situated somewhere in the middle, there are 4 ways to choose the make of these n cars, then there are 3 ways to choose the make of each of two cars adjacent to them (the makes of these two cars should be different from the make of n cars) and there are 4 ways to choose the make of each of the remaining n - 4 cars. So the formula for the case of n cars of the same make on a given position somewhere in the middle of the parking lot is 4·32·4n - 4.There are 2 positions of n cars of the same make in the end of the parking lot and there are n - 3 positions of n cars of the same make somewhere in the middle of the parking lot. So the final formula is 2·4·3·4n - 3 + (n - 3)·4·32·4n - 4.J. DivisibilityLet's factorize numbers from 2 to 10. 2 = 2, 3 = 3, 4 = 22, 5 = 5, 6 = 2·3, 7 = 7, 8 = 23, 9 = 32, 10 = 2·5. If a number is divisible by all numbers from 2 to 10, its factorization should contain 2 at least in the power of 3, 3 at least in the power of 2, 5 and 7 at least in the power of 1. So it can be written as x·23·32·5·7 = x·2520. So any number divisible by 2520 is divisible by all numbers from 2 to 10.There are numbers from 1 to n divisible by all numbers from 2 to 10. In a programming language it is usually implemented as simple integer division.K. IndivisibilityThe amount of numbers from 1 to n not divisible by any number from 2 to 10 is equal to the amount of all numbers from 1 to n (that is n) minus the amount of numbers from 1 to n divisible by some number from 2 to 10.The set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by some number from 2 to 10 can be found as union of the set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by 2, the set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by 3 and so on till 10.Note that sets of numbers divisible by 4 or 6 or 8 are subsets of the set of numbers divisible by 2, and sets of numbers divisible by 6 or 9 are subsets of the set of numbers divisible by 3. So there is no need to unite 9 sets, it is enough to unite sets for 2, 3, 5, 7 only.The size of set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by some of 2, 3, 5, 7 can be calculated using inclusion-exclusion principle that says that size of each single set should be added, size of pairwise intersections should be subtracted, size of all intersections of three sets should be added and so on.The size of set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by 2 is equal to , the size of set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by 2 and 3 is equal to and so on.The final formula is Division with rounding down in the formula in a programming language is usually just integer division.L. Cracking the CodeIn this problem just implementation of the actions described in the statement is required. However there are two catches in this problem.The first catch is that the fifth power of five-digit number cannot be represented by a 64-bit integer. But we need not the fifth power, we need the fifth power modulo 105. And mod operation can be applied after each multiplication (see problem A above).The second catch is that you need to output five digits, not the fifth power modulo 105. The difference is when fifth digit from the end is zero. To output a number with the leading zero one can either use corresponding formatting (%05d in printf) or extract digits and output them one by one.M. TurnFirst of all, let's reduce camera rotation angle to [0, 359] degrees range. It is accomplished by the following C++/Java code: angle = (angle % 360 + 360) % 360;Then there are the following cases: [0, 44] degrees — no need to rotate, 45 degrees — 0 or 1 turn to minimum deviation, minimum is 0, [46, 134] degrees — one turn required, 135 degrees — 1 or 2 turns to minimum deviation, minimum is 1, [136, 224] degrees — two turns required, 225 degrees — 2 or 3 turns to minimum deviation, minimum is 2, [226, 314] degrees — three turns required, 315 degrees — 3 or 0 turns to minimum deviation, minimum is 0, [316, 359] degrees — no need to rotate. Let's add 44 degrees to the angle from the range [0, 359]. C++/Java code is angle = (angle + 44) % 360; Then the ranges will be: [0, 89] degrees — 0 turns, [90, 179] degrees — 1 turn, [180, 269] degrees — 2 turns, [270, 358] degrees — 3 turns, 359 degrees — 0 turns. One special case of 359 degrees can be eliminated by taking angle modulo 359. Then just integer division by 90 is required to get the answer. C++/Java code is answer = (angle % 359) / 90;N. ForecastThere is nothing special in solving a quadratic equation but the problem has one catch. You should output the greater root first.The simplest approach is to output max(x1, x2) first, then min(x1, x2).Another approach is based upon the sign of a. for a > 0 and for a < 0.We can divide all coefficients by a, and then the first coefficient will be positive. But notice that division should be done in a floating point type and a should be divided last otherwise resulting a / a = 1 would not be able to divide b and c.O. ArrowTo get a vector of the given length b in the direction of the given vector (vx, vy) it is just required to normalize the given vector (divide it by its length) and then multiply by b.Let's denote , vnx = vx / len, vny = vy / len. Then (vnx, vny) is the normalized vector, and the first point of the arrow is (px + vnx·b, py + vny·b).To get the second point of the arrow one needs to rotate the normalized vector 90 degrees counter-clockwise and then multiply by the half of the triangle base a / 2. Let's denote vlx =  - vny, vly = vnx. Then (vlx, vly) is the normalized vector 90 degrees counter-clockwise to (vnx, vny). So the second point of the arrow is (px + vlx·a / 2, py + vly·a / 2).The third point can be found the same way as the second point but the length of the vector to it is c / 2. So the third point of the arrow is (px + vlx·c / 2, py + vly·c / 2).The fourth point can be found by adding the vector of the length c / 2 to the left of the given and the vector of the length d reverse to the given. So the fourth point of the arrow is (px + vlx·c / 2 - vnx·d, py + vly·c / 2 - vny·d).The remaining points are symmetrical to the points discussed above so they can be obtained the same way, just using minus for (vlx, vly) instead of plus. So the next points are (px - vlx·c / 2 - vnx·d, py - vly·c / 2 - vny·d), (px - vlx·c / 2, py - vly·c / 2), (px - vlx·a / 2, py - vly·a / 2).P. Area of a Star where n in the number of the star corners because in a regular star all angles between corners are equal. because of symmetry. because it is an inscribed angle. because of symmetry.So we know OA = r and and . We can calculate the area of AOB triangle knowing the length of a side and two angles adjacent to it using formula .The whole star area is equal to 2n areas of AOB triangle because of symmetry. .Q. PyramidsThe volume of a pyramid can be calculated as where v is the volume, s is the area of the base and h is the height from the base to the apex. Let's calculate s and h.The area of a regular polygon having n sides of length ln can be found the following way.On the figure above a regular polygon is shown. O is the center of the polygon, all sides are equal to ln, OB is the altitude of AOC triangle. As the polygon is a regular one OA = OC, AOC triangle is a isosceles one and then and AB = BC, also AOB and COB triangles are right-angled ones. Also because the polygon is a regular one and can be seen as a union of 2n triangles equal to AOB triangle then .AOB triangle is right-angled one, so , . Also . So and . The area of AOB is equal to . The area of the polygon is .On the figure above a triangle formed by the pyramid apex H, the center of the base O and some vertex of the base A is shown. It is a right-angled one. As all edges of the pyramid are equal, AH = ln and from calculations above . According to Pythagorean theorem OA2 + OH2 = AH2. So .The volume of one piramid is .And the final formula is .R. GameFor the field of an even size there is a winning strategy for the second player. Namely, to paint a cell that is symmetrical with respect to the center of the field to the cell painted by the first player on the previous turn. After each turn of the second player the field is centrosymmetrical and so there is always a cell that can be painted that is symmetrical with respect to the center of the field to any cell that the first player can choose to paint. .... 1... .1.. .... ....\n.... .... .... 1... .1..\n.... .... .... ...2 ..2.\n.... ...2 ..2. .... ....For the field of an odd size there is a winning strategy for the first player. Namely, on the first turn to paint the central cell, then to paint a cell that is symmetrical with respect to the center of the field to the cell painted by the second player on the previous turn. After each turn of the first player the field is centrosymmetrical and so there is always a cell that can be painted that is symmetrical with respect to the center of the field to any cell that the second player can choose to paint. ..... 2.... .2... ..2.. .....\n..... ..... ..... ..... .2...\n..1.. ..1.. ..1.. ..1.. ..1..\n..... ..... ..... ..... ...1.\n..... ....1 ...1. ..1.. .....So for even n the answer is 2, for odd n the answer is 1. One of the possible formulas for the problem is .n can be up to 1018 so at least 64-bit integer type should be used to input it.",

          "content": "A. Again Twenty Five!The problem of getting the last two digits is equivalent to the problem of getting the number modulo 100. So we need to calculate . According to the rules of modular arithmeticSoLet's note that 52 = 25. ThenAnd so on. All are equal to 25 for all n ≥ 2.So to solve the problem one need to just output 25. There is no need to read n.B. Moore's LawEvery second the number is multiplied by 1.000000011. Multiplication several times to the same number is equivalent to exponentiation. So the formula is n·1.000000011t (1.000000011 raised to the power of t and then multiplied to n). In a program one should not use a loop to calculate power as it is too slow for such big n, usually a programming language provides a function for exponentiation such as pow.C. Lucky NumbersThere are 2 lucky numbers of the length 1. They are 7 and 8. There are 4 lucky numbers of the length 2. They are 77, 78, 87 and 88. There are 8 lucky numbers of the length 3. They are 777, 778, 787, 788, 877, 878, 887, 888. For each addition of 1 to the length the number of lucky numbers is increased times 2. It is easy to prove: to any number of the previous length one can append 7 or 8, so one number of the prevous length creates two numbers of the next length.So for the length n the amount of lucky numbers of the length exactly n is 2n. But in the problem we need the amount of lucky numbers of length not greater than n. Let's sum up them. 21 = 2, 21 + 22 = 2 + 4 = 6, 21 + 22 + 23 = 2 + 4 + 8 = 14, 21 + 22 + 23 + 24 = 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 30. One can notice that the sum of all previous powers of two is equal to the next power of two minus the first power of two. So the answer to the problem is 2n + 1 - 2.One of the possible implementations of 2n + 1 in a programming language is to shift 1 bitwise to the left for n + 1 binary digits or to shift 2 bitwise to the left for n binary digits. For example, in Java the problem answer formula is (2L << n) - 2, in C++ is (2LL << n) - 2. Suffixes L and LL correspondingly are required so that result of the shift expression have 64-bit integer type (long in Java and long long in C++). Type of the second operand does not matter for the type of shift expression, only the type of the first operand. Also parenthesis are required because without them subtraction is performed first and only then bitwise shift.D. Hexagons!Let's count the number of cells having the distance of exactly n. For n = 0 it is 1, for n = 1 it is 6, for n = 2 it is 12, for n = 3 it is 18 and so on. One can notice that n = 0 is a special case, and then the amount increases by addition of 6. These numbers form an arithmetic progression. In the problem we need to sum these numbers. The formula of the sum of an arithmetic progression is (first + last)·amount / 2. The first is 6, the last is 6n, the amount is n. So the sum is (6 + 6n)n / 2 = 3(n + 1)n. And plus 1 that is not in the arithmetic progression. So the final formula is 1 + 3n(n + 1).To avoid overflow, multiplication in the formula should be performed in 64-bit integer type. For this either 3 or 1 or n should have 64-bit integer type. The literals are 64-bit integer when they have suffix L in Java or LL in C++.E. A rectangleLet's see how the number of affected cells changes depending on the column. For example 3, 2, 3, 2, 3. That is it alternates between the size of the first column and the size of the first column minus one. The amount of \"minus ones\" is the amount of columns divided by 2 rounded down. Without \"minus ones\" all columns have equal size and the total amount of cells is equal to size of the first column multiplied by the number of the columns. The first column size is (y2 - y1) / 2 + 1. The columns amount is x2 - x1 + 1. So the final formula is ((y2 - y1) / 2 + 1)·(x2 - x1 + 1) - (x2 - x1) / 2.To avoid overflow, multiplication should be computed in 64-bit integer type.F. Selection of PersonnelThe amount of ways to choose a group of 5 people from n candidates is equal to the number of combinations , the amount of ways to choose a group of 6 people from n candidates is , the amount of ways to choose a group of 7 people from n candidates is , the amount of ways to choose a group of 5, 6 or 7 people from n candidates is .To avoid 64-bit integer overflow can be calculated in the following way: n / 1 * (n - 1) / 2 * (n - 2) / 3 * (n - 3) / 4 * (n - 4) / 5 * (n - 5) / 6 * (n - 6) / 7. Each division returns an integer because each prefix of this formula after division is also the number of combinations .G. Challenge PennantsFirst of all, ways to place both types of the pennants are independent. So each way to place \"I fixed a critical bug\" pennants on n tables is compatible to each way to place \"I suggested a new feature\" pennants on n tables. Therefore the answer of the problem is equal to the number of ways to place \"I fixed a critical bug\" pennants multiplied by the number of ways to place \"I suggested a new feature\" pennant.The number of ways to place k identical items into n different places when any place can contain any amount of items is the definition of the number of k-combinations with repetitions or k-multicombinations. The formula for the number is .So the whole formula for the problem is .To avoid overflow of 64-bit integer type recommended formulas for computation are (n + 2) / 1 * (n + 1) / 2 * n / 3 and (n + 4) / 1 * (n + 3) / 2 * (n + 2) / 3 * (n + 1) / 4 * n / 5.H. BenchesThe number of ways to choose 5 east to west paths that will have benches from n is . There are n ways to place a bench on the first of these paths. Given the place of the first bench there are n - 1 ways to place a bench on the second of these paths because one of north to south paths is already taken. Given the places of the first and second benches there are n - 2 ways to place a bench on the third of these paths because two of north to south paths are already taken. And the same way n - 3 and n - 4 for the fourth and the fifth benches. Total number of ways to place benches on selected 5 east to west path is n(n - 1)(n - 2)(n - 3)(n - 4). So the formula for the problem is .To avoid 64-bit integer overflow recommended order of computation is exactly as in the formula above, division should not be the last operation.I. Parking LotThere are the following ways to place n cars of the same make. They can be the first n, the last n, or they can be somewhere in the middle of the parking lot.When n cars of the same make are the first or the last, there are 4 ways to choose the make of these n cars, then there are 3 ways to choose the make of one car adjacent to them (the make should be different from the make of n cars) and there are 4 ways to choose the make of each of the remaining n - 3 cars. So the formula for the case of n cars of the same make on either end of the parking lot is 4·3·4n - 3.When n cars of the same make are situated somewhere in the middle, there are 4 ways to choose the make of these n cars, then there are 3 ways to choose the make of each of two cars adjacent to them (the makes of these two cars should be different from the make of n cars) and there are 4 ways to choose the make of each of the remaining n - 4 cars. So the formula for the case of n cars of the same make on a given position somewhere in the middle of the parking lot is 4·32·4n - 4.There are 2 positions of n cars of the same make in the end of the parking lot and there are n - 3 positions of n cars of the same make somewhere in the middle of the parking lot. So the final formula is 2·4·3·4n - 3 + (n - 3)·4·32·4n - 4.J. DivisibilityLet's factorize numbers from 2 to 10. 2 = 2, 3 = 3, 4 = 22, 5 = 5, 6 = 2·3, 7 = 7, 8 = 23, 9 = 32, 10 = 2·5. If a number is divisible by all numbers from 2 to 10, its factorization should contain 2 at least in the power of 3, 3 at least in the power of 2, 5 and 7 at least in the power of 1. So it can be written as x·23·32·5·7 = x·2520. So any number divisible by 2520 is divisible by all numbers from 2 to 10.There are numbers from 1 to n divisible by all numbers from 2 to 10. In a programming language it is usually implemented as simple integer division.K. IndivisibilityThe amount of numbers from 1 to n not divisible by any number from 2 to 10 is equal to the amount of all numbers from 1 to n (that is n) minus the amount of numbers from 1 to n divisible by some number from 2 to 10.The set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by some number from 2 to 10 can be found as union of the set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by 2, the set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by 3 and so on till 10.Note that sets of numbers divisible by 4 or 6 or 8 are subsets of the set of numbers divisible by 2, and sets of numbers divisible by 6 or 9 are subsets of the set of numbers divisible by 3. So there is no need to unite 9 sets, it is enough to unite sets for 2, 3, 5, 7 only.The size of set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by some of 2, 3, 5, 7 can be calculated using inclusion-exclusion principle that says that size of each single set should be added, size of pairwise intersections should be subtracted, size of all intersections of three sets should be added and so on.The size of set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by 2 is equal to , the size of set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by 2 and 3 is equal to and so on.The final formula is Division with rounding down in the formula in a programming language is usually just integer division.L. Cracking the CodeIn this problem just implementation of the actions described in the statement is required. However there are two catches in this problem.The first catch is that the fifth power of five-digit number cannot be represented by a 64-bit integer. But we need not the fifth power, we need the fifth power modulo 105. And mod operation can be applied after each multiplication (see problem A above).The second catch is that you need to output five digits, not the fifth power modulo 105. The difference is when fifth digit from the end is zero. To output a number with the leading zero one can either use corresponding formatting (%05d in printf) or extract digits and output them one by one.M. TurnFirst of all, let's reduce camera rotation angle to [0, 359] degrees range. It is accomplished by the following C++/Java code: angle = (angle % 360 + 360) % 360;Then there are the following cases: [0, 44] degrees — no need to rotate, 45 degrees — 0 or 1 turn to minimum deviation, minimum is 0, [46, 134] degrees — one turn required, 135 degrees — 1 or 2 turns to minimum deviation, minimum is 1, [136, 224] degrees — two turns required, 225 degrees — 2 or 3 turns to minimum deviation, minimum is 2, [226, 314] degrees — three turns required, 315 degrees — 3 or 0 turns to minimum deviation, minimum is 0, [316, 359] degrees — no need to rotate. Let's add 44 degrees to the angle from the range [0, 359]. C++/Java code is angle = (angle + 44) % 360; Then the ranges will be: [0, 89] degrees — 0 turns, [90, 179] degrees — 1 turn, [180, 269] degrees — 2 turns, [270, 358] degrees — 3 turns, 359 degrees — 0 turns. One special case of 359 degrees can be eliminated by taking angle modulo 359. Then just integer division by 90 is required to get the answer. C++/Java code is answer = (angle % 359) / 90;N. ForecastThere is nothing special in solving a quadratic equation but the problem has one catch. You should output the greater root first.The simplest approach is to output max(x1, x2) first, then min(x1, x2).Another approach is based upon the sign of a. for a > 0 and for a < 0.We can divide all coefficients by a, and then the first coefficient will be positive. But notice that division should be done in a floating point type and a should be divided last otherwise resulting a / a = 1 would not be able to divide b and c.O. ArrowTo get a vector of the given length b in the direction of the given vector (vx, vy) it is just required to normalize the given vector (divide it by its length) and then multiply by b.Let's denote , vnx = vx / len, vny = vy / len. Then (vnx, vny) is the normalized vector, and the first point of the arrow is (px + vnx·b, py + vny·b).To get the second point of the arrow one needs to rotate the normalized vector 90 degrees counter-clockwise and then multiply by the half of the triangle base a / 2. Let's denote vlx =  - vny, vly = vnx. Then (vlx, vly) is the normalized vector 90 degrees counter-clockwise to (vnx, vny). So the second point of the arrow is (px + vlx·a / 2, py + vly·a / 2).The third point can be found the same way as the second point but the length of the vector to it is c / 2. So the third point of the arrow is (px + vlx·c / 2, py + vly·c / 2).The fourth point can be found by adding the vector of the length c / 2 to the left of the given and the vector of the length d reverse to the given. So the fourth point of the arrow is (px + vlx·c / 2 - vnx·d, py + vly·c / 2 - vny·d).The remaining points are symmetrical to the points discussed above so they can be obtained the same way, just using minus for (vlx, vly) instead of plus. So the next points are (px - vlx·c / 2 - vnx·d, py - vly·c / 2 - vny·d), (px - vlx·c / 2, py - vly·c / 2), (px - vlx·a / 2, py - vly·a / 2).P. Area of a Star where n in the number of the star corners because in a regular star all angles between corners are equal. because of symmetry. because it is an inscribed angle. because of symmetry.So we know OA = r and and . We can calculate the area of AOB triangle knowing the length of a side and two angles adjacent to it using formula .The whole star area is equal to 2n areas of AOB triangle because of symmetry. .Q. PyramidsThe volume of a pyramid can be calculated as where v is the volume, s is the area of the base and h is the height from the base to the apex. Let's calculate s and h.The area of a regular polygon having n sides of length ln can be found the following way.On the figure above a regular polygon is shown. O is the center of the polygon, all sides are equal to ln, OB is the altitude of AOC triangle. As the polygon is a regular one OA = OC, AOC triangle is a isosceles one and then and AB = BC, also AOB and COB triangles are right-angled ones. Also because the polygon is a regular one and can be seen as a union of 2n triangles equal to AOB triangle then .AOB triangle is right-angled one, so , . Also . So and . The area of AOB is equal to . The area of the polygon is .On the figure above a triangle formed by the pyramid apex H, the center of the base O and some vertex of the base A is shown. It is a right-angled one. As all edges of the pyramid are equal, AH = ln and from calculations above . According to Pythagorean theorem OA2 + OH2 = AH2. So .The volume of one piramid is .And the final formula is .R. GameFor the field of an even size there is a winning strategy for the second player. Namely, to paint a cell that is symmetrical with respect to the center of the field to the cell painted by the first player on the previous turn. After each turn of the second player the field is centrosymmetrical and so there is always a cell that can be painted that is symmetrical with respect to the center of the field to any cell that the first player can choose to paint. .... 1... .1.. .... ....\n.... .... .... 1... .1..\n.... .... .... ...2 ..2.\n.... ...2 ..2. .... ....For the field of an odd size there is a winning strategy for the first player. Namely, on the first turn to paint the central cell, then to paint a cell that is symmetrical with respect to the center of the field to the cell painted by the second player on the previous turn. After each turn of the first player the field is centrosymmetrical and so there is always a cell that can be painted that is symmetrical with respect to the center of the field to any cell that the second player can choose to paint. ..... 2.... .2... ..2.. .....\n..... ..... ..... ..... .2...\n..1.. ..1.. ..1.. ..1.. ..1..\n..... ..... ..... ..... ...1.\n..... ....1 ...1. ..1.. .....So for even n the answer is 2, for odd n the answer is 1. One of the possible formulas for the problem is .n can be up to 1018 so at least 64-bit integer type should be used to input it.",

          "content": "A. Again Twenty Five!The problem of getting the last two digits is equivalent to the problem of getting the number modulo 100. So we need to calculate . According to the rules of modular arithmeticSoLet's note that 52 = 25. ThenAnd so on. All are equal to 25 for all n ≥ 2.So to solve the problem one need to just output 25. There is no need to read n.B. Moore's LawEvery second the number is multiplied by 1.000000011. Multiplication several times to the same number is equivalent to exponentiation. So the formula is n·1.000000011t (1.000000011 raised to the power of t and then multiplied to n). In a program one should not use a loop to calculate power as it is too slow for such big n, usually a programming language provides a function for exponentiation such as pow.C. Lucky NumbersThere are 2 lucky numbers of the length 1. They are 7 and 8. There are 4 lucky numbers of the length 2. They are 77, 78, 87 and 88. There are 8 lucky numbers of the length 3. They are 777, 778, 787, 788, 877, 878, 887, 888. For each addition of 1 to the length the number of lucky numbers is increased times 2. It is easy to prove: to any number of the previous length one can append 7 or 8, so one number of the prevous length creates two numbers of the next length.So for the length n the amount of lucky numbers of the length exactly n is 2n. But in the problem we need the amount of lucky numbers of length not greater than n. Let's sum up them. 21 = 2, 21 + 22 = 2 + 4 = 6, 21 + 22 + 23 = 2 + 4 + 8 = 14, 21 + 22 + 23 + 24 = 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 30. One can notice that the sum of all previous powers of two is equal to the next power of two minus the first power of two. So the answer to the problem is 2n + 1 - 2.One of the possible implementations of 2n + 1 in a programming language is to shift 1 bitwise to the left for n + 1 binary digits or to shift 2 bitwise to the left for n binary digits. For example, in Java the problem answer formula is (2L << n) - 2, in C++ is (2LL << n) - 2. Suffixes L and LL correspondingly are required so that result of the shift expression have 64-bit integer type (long in Java and long long in C++). Type of the second operand does not matter for the type of shift expression, only the type of the first operand. Also parenthesis are required because without them subtraction is performed first and only then bitwise shift.D. Hexagons!Let's count the number of cells having the distance of exactly n. For n = 0 it is 1, for n = 1 it is 6, for n = 2 it is 12, for n = 3 it is 18 and so on. One can notice that n = 0 is a special case, and then the amount increases by addition of 6. These numbers form an arithmetic progression. In the problem we need to sum these numbers. The formula of the sum of an arithmetic progression is (first + last)·amount / 2. The first is 6, the last is 6n, the amount is n. So the sum is (6 + 6n)n / 2 = 3(n + 1)n. And plus 1 that is not in the arithmetic progression. So the final formula is 1 + 3n(n + 1).To avoid overflow, multiplication in the formula should be performed in 64-bit integer type. For this either 3 or 1 or n should have 64-bit integer type. The literals are 64-bit integer when they have suffix L in Java or LL in C++.E. A rectangleLet's see how the number of affected cells changes depending on the column. For example 3, 2, 3, 2, 3. That is it alternates between the size of the first column and the size of the first column minus one. The amount of \"minus ones\" is the amount of columns divided by 2 rounded down. Without \"minus ones\" all columns have equal size and the total amount of cells is equal to size of the first column multiplied by the number of the columns. The first column size is (y2 - y1) / 2 + 1. The columns amount is x2 - x1 + 1. So the final formula is ((y2 - y1) / 2 + 1)·(x2 - x1 + 1) - (x2 - x1) / 2.To avoid overflow, multiplication should be computed in 64-bit integer type.F. Selection of PersonnelThe amount of ways to choose a group of 5 people from n candidates is equal to the number of combinations , the amount of ways to choose a group of 6 people from n candidates is , the amount of ways to choose a group of 7 people from n candidates is , the amount of ways to choose a group of 5, 6 or 7 people from n candidates is .To avoid 64-bit integer overflow can be calculated in the following way: n / 1 * (n - 1) / 2 * (n - 2) / 3 * (n - 3) / 4 * (n - 4) / 5 * (n - 5) / 6 * (n - 6) / 7. Each division returns an integer because each prefix of this formula after division is also the number of combinations .G. Challenge PennantsFirst of all, ways to place both types of the pennants are independent. So each way to place \"I fixed a critical bug\" pennants on n tables is compatible to each way to place \"I suggested a new feature\" pennants on n tables. Therefore the answer of the problem is equal to the number of ways to place \"I fixed a critical bug\" pennants multiplied by the number of ways to place \"I suggested a new feature\" pennant.The number of ways to place k identical items into n different places when any place can contain any amount of items is the definition of the number of k-combinations with repetitions or k-multicombinations. The formula for the number is .So the whole formula for the problem is .To avoid overflow of 64-bit integer type recommended formulas for computation are (n + 2) / 1 * (n + 1) / 2 * n / 3 and (n + 4) / 1 * (n + 3) / 2 * (n + 2) / 3 * (n + 1) / 4 * n / 5.H. BenchesThe number of ways to choose 5 east to west paths that will have benches from n is . There are n ways to place a bench on the first of these paths. Given the place of the first bench there are n - 1 ways to place a bench on the second of these paths because one of north to south paths is already taken. Given the places of the first and second benches there are n - 2 ways to place a bench on the third of these paths because two of north to south paths are already taken. And the same way n - 3 and n - 4 for the fourth and the fifth benches. Total number of ways to place benches on selected 5 east to west path is n(n - 1)(n - 2)(n - 3)(n - 4). So the formula for the problem is .To avoid 64-bit integer overflow recommended order of computation is exactly as in the formula above, division should not be the last operation.I. Parking LotThere are the following ways to place n cars of the same make. They can be the first n, the last n, or they can be somewhere in the middle of the parking lot.When n cars of the same make are the first or the last, there are 4 ways to choose the make of these n cars, then there are 3 ways to choose the make of one car adjacent to them (the make should be different from the make of n cars) and there are 4 ways to choose the make of each of the remaining n - 3 cars. So the formula for the case of n cars of the same make on either end of the parking lot is 4·3·4n - 3.When n cars of the same make are situated somewhere in the middle, there are 4 ways to choose the make of these n cars, then there are 3 ways to choose the make of each of two cars adjacent to them (the makes of these two cars should be different from the make of n cars) and there are 4 ways to choose the make of each of the remaining n - 4 cars. So the formula for the case of n cars of the same make on a given position somewhere in the middle of the parking lot is 4·32·4n - 4.There are 2 positions of n cars of the same make in the end of the parking lot and there are n - 3 positions of n cars of the same make somewhere in the middle of the parking lot. So the final formula is 2·4·3·4n - 3 + (n - 3)·4·32·4n - 4.J. DivisibilityLet's factorize numbers from 2 to 10. 2 = 2, 3 = 3, 4 = 22, 5 = 5, 6 = 2·3, 7 = 7, 8 = 23, 9 = 32, 10 = 2·5. If a number is divisible by all numbers from 2 to 10, its factorization should contain 2 at least in the power of 3, 3 at least in the power of 2, 5 and 7 at least in the power of 1. So it can be written as x·23·32·5·7 = x·2520. So any number divisible by 2520 is divisible by all numbers from 2 to 10.There are numbers from 1 to n divisible by all numbers from 2 to 10. In a programming language it is usually implemented as simple integer division.K. IndivisibilityThe amount of numbers from 1 to n not divisible by any number from 2 to 10 is equal to the amount of all numbers from 1 to n (that is n) minus the amount of numbers from 1 to n divisible by some number from 2 to 10.The set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by some number from 2 to 10 can be found as union of the set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by 2, the set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by 3 and so on till 10.Note that sets of numbers divisible by 4 or 6 or 8 are subsets of the set of numbers divisible by 2, and sets of numbers divisible by 6 or 9 are subsets of the set of numbers divisible by 3. So there is no need to unite 9 sets, it is enough to unite sets for 2, 3, 5, 7 only.The size of set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by some of 2, 3, 5, 7 can be calculated using inclusion-exclusion principle that says that size of each single set should be added, size of pairwise intersections should be subtracted, size of all intersections of three sets should be added and so on.The size of set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by 2 is equal to , the size of set of numbers from 1 to n divisible by 2 and 3 is equal to and so on.The final formula is Division with rounding down in the formula in a programming language is usually just integer division.L. Cracking the CodeIn this problem just implementation of the actions described in the statement is required. However there are two catches in this problem.The first catch is that the fifth power of five-digit number cannot be represented by a 64-bit integer. But we need not the fifth power, we need the fifth power modulo 105. And mod operation can be applied after each multiplication (see problem A above).The second catch is that you need to output five digits, not the fifth power modulo 105. The difference is when fifth digit from the end is zero. To output a number with the leading zero one can either use corresponding formatting (%05d in printf) or extract digits and output them one by one.M. TurnFirst of all, let's reduce camera rotation angle to [0, 359] degrees range. It is accomplished by the following C++/Java code: angle = (angle % 360 + 360) % 360;Then there are the following cases: [0, 44] degrees — no need to rotate, 45 degrees — 0 or 1 turn to minimum deviation, minimum is 0, [46, 134] degrees — one turn required, 135 degrees — 1 or 2 turns to minimum deviation, minimum is 1, [136, 224] degrees — two turns required, 225 degrees — 2 or 3 turns to minimum deviation, minimum is 2, [226, 314] degrees — three turns required, 315 degrees — 3 or 0 turns to minimum deviation, minimum is 0, [316, 359] degrees — no need to rotate. Let's add 44 degrees to the angle from the range [0, 359]. C++/Java code is angle = (angle + 44) % 360; Then the ranges will be: [0, 89] degrees — 0 turns, [90, 179] degrees — 1 turn, [180, 269] degrees — 2 turns, [270, 358] degrees — 3 turns, 359 degrees — 0 turns. One special case of 359 degrees can be eliminated by taking angle modulo 359. Then just integer division by 90 is required to get the answer. C++/Java code is answer = (angle % 359) / 90;N. ForecastThere is nothing special in solving a quadratic equation but the problem has one catch. You should output the greater root first.The simplest approach is to output max(x1, x2) first, then min(x1, x2).Another approach is based upon the sign of a. for a > 0 and for a < 0.We can divide all coefficients by a, and then the first coefficient will be positive. But notice that division should be done in a floating point type and a should be divided last otherwise resulting a / a = 1 would not be able to divide b and c.O. ArrowTo get a vector of the given length b in the direction of the given vector (vx, vy) it is just required to normalize the given vector (divide it by its length) and then multiply by b.Let's denote , vnx = vx / len, vny = vy / len. Then (vnx, vny) is the normalized vector, and the first point of the arrow is (px + vnx·b, py + vny·b).To get the second point of the arrow one needs to rotate the normalized vector 90 degrees counter-clockwise and then multiply by the half of the triangle base a / 2. Let's denote vlx =  - vny, vly = vnx. Then (vlx, vly) is the normalized vector 90 degrees counter-clockwise to (vnx, vny). So the second point of the arrow is (px + vlx·a / 2, py + vly·a / 2).The third point can be found the same way as the second point but the length of the vector to it is c / 2. So the third point of the arrow is (px + vlx·c / 2, py + vly·c / 2).The fourth point can be found by adding the vector of the length c / 2 to the left of the given and the vector of the length d reverse to the given. So the fourth point of the arrow is (px + vlx·c / 2 - vnx·d, py + vly·c / 2 - vny·d).The remaining points are symmetrical to the points discussed above so they can be obtained the same way, just using minus for (vlx, vly) instead of plus. So the next points are (px - vlx·c / 2 - vnx·d, py - vly·c / 2 - vny·d), (px - vlx·c / 2, py - vly·c / 2), (px - vlx·a / 2, py - vly·a / 2).P. Area of a Star where n in the number of the star corners because in a regular star all angles between corners are equal. because of symmetry. because it is an inscribed angle. because of symmetry.So we know OA = r and and . We can calculate the area of AOB triangle knowing the length of a side and two angles adjacent to it using formula .The whole star area is equal to 2n areas of AOB triangle because of symmetry. .Q. PyramidsThe volume of a pyramid can be calculated as where v is the volume, s is the area of the base and h is the height from the base to the apex. Let's calculate s and h.The area of a regular polygon having n sides of length ln can be found the following way.On the figure above a regular polygon is shown. O is the center of the polygon, all sides are equal to ln, OB is the altitude of AOC triangle. As the polygon is a regular one OA = OC, AOC triangle is a isosceles one and then and AB = BC, also AOB and COB triangles are right-angled ones. Also because the polygon is a regular one and can be seen as a union of 2n triangles equal to AOB triangle then .AOB triangle is right-angled one, so , . Also . So and . The area of AOB is equal to . The area of the polygon is .On the figure above a triangle formed by the pyramid apex H, the center of the base O and some vertex of the base A is shown. It is a right-angled one. As all edges of the pyramid are equal, AH = ln and from calculations above . According to Pythagorean theorem OA2 + OH2 = AH2. So .The volume of one piramid is .And the final formula is .R. GameFor the field of an even size there is a winning strategy for the second player. Namely, to paint a cell that is symmetrical with respect to the center of the field to the cell painted by the first player on the previous turn. After each turn of the second player the field is centrosymmetrical and so there is always a cell that can be painted that is symmetrical with respect to the center of the field to any cell that the first player can choose to paint. .... 1... .1.. .... ....\n.... .... .... 1... .1..\n.... .... .... ...2 ..2.\n.... ...2 ..2. .... ....For the field of an odd size there is a winning strategy for the first player. Namely, on the first turn to paint the central cell, then to paint a cell that is symmetrical with respect to the center of the field to the cell painted by the second player on the previous turn. After each turn of the first player the field is centrosymmetrical and so there is always a cell that can be painted that is symmetrical with respect to the center of the field to any cell that the second player can choose to paint. ..... 2.... .2... ..2.. .....\n..... ..... ..... ..... .2...\n..1.. ..1.. ..1.. ..1.. ..1..\n..... ..... ..... ..... ...1.\n..... ....1 ...1. ..1.. .....So for even n the answer is 2, for odd n the answer is 1. One of the possible formulas for the problem is .n can be up to 1018 so at least 64-bit integer type should be used to input it.",

This is our first round, but it doesn’t mean that problems will be boring and not interesting. The problemsetters of this round are me (wilcot) and Ilya Kheifets (xfce8888). Thanks a lot to Alex Vistyazh (netman) and unknown person (he don’t want to be added in the announcement) for testing our round. Also I’d like to thank Fedor Korobeynikov (Mediocrity) for his awesome idea for task E.We thank Gleb Evstropov (GlebsHP) for his help in preparing the contest, Maria Belova (Delinur) for translating the statements into English, and, of course, Codeforces team and Mike Mirzayanov for unique Codeforces and Polygon platforms.This round consists of five problems. Main heroes of this round: Blake — the owner of the \"Blake Technologies\" company, and Chris — an employee of this company, and others.Scoring distribution: 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500.Good luck, have fun.PS.

          "content": "631A - InterviewYou should know only one fact to solve this task: . This fact can be proved by the truth table. Let's use this fact: . Also . According two previous formulas we can get that f(a, 1, n) ≥ f(a, i, j). Finally we can get the answer. It's equal to f(a, 1, N) + f(b, 1, N).Time: Memory: C++ Python3 631B - Print CheckLet's define timeRi as a number of last query, wich repaint row with number i, timeCj – as number of last query, wich repaint column with number j. The value in cell (i, j) is equal amax(timeRi, timeCj).Time: Memory: C++ Python3631C - ReportIf we have some pair of queries that ri ≥ rj, i > j, then we can skip query with number j. Let's skip such queries. After that we get an array of sorted queries (ri ≤ rj, i > j). Let's sort subarray a1..max(ri) and copy it to b. For proccessing query with number i we should record to ari - 1..ri first or last(it depends on ti - 1) ri - 1 - ri + 1 elementes of b. After that this elements should be extract from b. You should remember that you need to sort subarray a1..rn, after last query.Time: Memeory: C++ Python3 631D - MessengerLet's define S[i] as i - th block of S, T[i] — as i - th block of T.Also S[l..r] = S[l]S[l + 1]...S[r] and T[l..r] = T[l]T[l + 1]...T[r].T is substring of S, if S[l + 1..r - 1] = T[2..m - 1] and S[l].l = T[1].l and S[l].c ≥ T[1].c and S[r].l = T[m].l and S[r].c ≥ T[m].c. Let's find all matches of T[l + 1..r - 1] in S and chose from this matches, witch is equal T.You can do this by Knuth–Morris–Pratt algorithm.This task has a some tricky test cases: and . Letters in the adjacent blocks are may be same.This problem can be solved by the union of adjacent blocks with same letter. and . Count of T blocks are less than 3. Such cases can be proccess singly. and . Answer for this test should be stored at long long. Time: Memory: C++Python3631E - Product SumThe operation, which has been described in the statement, is cyclic shift of some subarray. Let's try to solve this problem separately for left cyclic shift and for right cyclic shift. Let's define as answer before(or without) cyclic shift, Δans = ans - ans' — difference between answer after cyclic shift and before. This difference can be found by next formulas:For left cyclic shift:Δl, r = (al·r + al + 1·l + ... + ar·(r - 1)) - (al·l + al + 1·(l + 1) + ... + ar·r) = al·(r - l) - (al + 1 + al + 2 + ... + ar)For right cyclic shift:Δ'l, r = (al·(l + 1) + al + 1·(l + 2) + ... + ar·l) + (al·l + al + 1·(l + 1) + ... + ar·r) = (al + al + 1 + ... + ar - 1) + ar·(l - r)You can find this values with complexity , using prefix sums, .Let's try to rewrite previous formulas:For left cyclic shift: Δl, r = (al·r - sumr) + (suml - al·l)For right cyclic shift: Δ'l, r = (ar·l - suml - 1) + (sumr - 1 - ar·r)You can see, that if you fix l for left shift and r for right shift, you can solve this problem with complexity using Convex Hull Trick.Time: Memory: C++",

This is our first round, but it doesn’t mean that problems will be boring and not interesting. The problemsetters of this round are me (wilcot) and Ilya Kheifets (xfce8888). Thanks a lot to Alex Vistyazh (netman) and unknown person (he don’t want to be added in the announcement) for testing our round. Also I’d like to thank Fedor Korobeynikov (Mediocrity) for his awesome idea for task E.We thank Gleb Evstropov (GlebsHP) for his help in preparing the contest, Maria Belova (Delinur) for translating the statements into English, and, of course, Codeforces team and Mike Mirzayanov for unique Codeforces and Polygon platforms.This round consists of five problems. Main heroes of this round: Blake — the owner of the \"Blake Technologies\" company, and Chris — an employee of this company, and others.Scoring distribution: 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500.Good luck, have fun.PS.

          "content": "631A - InterviewYou should know only one fact to solve this task: . This fact can be proved by the truth table. Let's use this fact: . Also . According two previous formulas we can get that f(a, 1, n) ≥ f(a, i, j). Finally we can get the answer. It's equal to f(a, 1, N) + f(b, 1, N).Time: Memory: C++ Python3 631B - Print CheckLet's define timeRi as a number of last query, wich repaint row with number i, timeCj – as number of last query, wich repaint column with number j. The value in cell (i, j) is equal amax(timeRi, timeCj).Time: Memory: C++ Python3631C - ReportIf we have some pair of queries that ri ≥ rj, i > j, then we can skip query with number j. Let's skip such queries. After that we get an array of sorted queries (ri ≤ rj, i > j). Let's sort subarray a1..max(ri) and copy it to b. For proccessing query with number i we should record to ari - 1..ri first or last(it depends on ti - 1) ri - 1 - ri + 1 elementes of b. After that this elements should be extract from b. You should remember that you need to sort subarray a1..rn, after last query.Time: Memeory: C++ Python3 631D - MessengerLet's define S[i] as i - th block of S, T[i] — as i - th block of T.Also S[l..r] = S[l]S[l + 1]...S[r] and T[l..r] = T[l]T[l + 1]...T[r].T is substring of S, if S[l + 1..r - 1] = T[2..m - 1] and S[l].l = T[1].l and S[l].c ≥ T[1].c and S[r].l = T[m].l and S[r].c ≥ T[m].c. Let's find all matches of T[l + 1..r - 1] in S and chose from this matches, witch is equal T.You can do this by Knuth–Morris–Pratt algorithm.This task has a some tricky test cases: and . Letters in the adjacent blocks are may be same.This problem can be solved by the union of adjacent blocks with same letter. and . Count of T blocks are less than 3. Such cases can be proccess singly. and . Answer for this test should be stored at long long. Time: Memory: C++Python3631E - Product SumThe operation, which has been described in the statement, is cyclic shift of some subarray. Let's try to solve this problem separately for left cyclic shift and for right cyclic shift. Let's define as answer before(or without) cyclic shift, Δans = ans - ans' — difference between answer after cyclic shift and before. This difference can be found by next formulas:For left cyclic shift:Δl, r = (al·r + al + 1·l + ... + ar·(r - 1)) - (al·l + al + 1·(l + 1) + ... + ar·r) = al·(r - l) - (al + 1 + al + 2 + ... + ar)For right cyclic shift:Δ'l, r = (al·(l + 1) + al + 1·(l + 2) + ... + ar·l) + (al·l + al + 1·(l + 1) + ... + ar·r) = (al + al + 1 + ... + ar - 1) + ar·(l - r)You can find this values with complexity , using prefix sums, .Let's try to rewrite previous formulas:For left cyclic shift: Δl, r = (al·r - sumr) + (suml - al·l)For right cyclic shift: Δ'l, r = (ar·l - suml - 1) + (sumr - 1 - ar·r)You can see, that if you fix l for left shift and r for right shift, you can solve this problem with complexity using Convex Hull Trick.Time: Memory: C++",

This is our first round, but it doesn’t mean that problems will be boring and not interesting. The problemsetters of this round are me (wilcot) and Ilya Kheifets (xfce8888). Thanks a lot to Alex Vistyazh (netman) and unknown person (he don’t want to be added in the announcement) for testing our round. Also I’d like to thank Fedor Korobeynikov (Mediocrity) for his awesome idea for task E.We thank Gleb Evstropov (GlebsHP) for his help in preparing the contest, Maria Belova (Delinur) for translating the statements into English, and, of course, Codeforces team and Mike Mirzayanov for unique Codeforces and Polygon platforms.This round consists of five problems. Main heroes of this round: Blake — the owner of the \"Blake Technologies\" company, and Chris — an employee of this company, and others.Scoring distribution: 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500.Good luck, have fun.PS. Editorial is ready.PPS. Congratulations to the winners:Div. 2: lovelive Murtazo.Ali chychmek chrome Batman Div. 1: Um_nik chffy natsugiri ershov.stanislav AndreiNet",

          "content": "631A - InterviewYou should know only one fact to solve this task: . This fact can be proved by the truth table. Let's use this fact: . Also . According two previous formulas we can get that f(a, 1, n) ≥ f(a, i, j). Finally we can get the answer. It's equal to f(a, 1, N) + f(b, 1, N).Time: Memory: C++ Python3 631B - Print CheckLet's define timeRi as a number of last query, wich repaint row with number i, timeCj – as number of last query, wich repaint column with number j. The value in cell (i, j) is equal amax(timeRi, timeCj).Time: Memory: C++ Python3631C - ReportIf we have some pair of queries that ri ≥ rj, i > j, then we can skip query with number j. Let's skip such queries. After that we get an array of sorted queries (ri ≤ rj, i > j). Let's sort subarray a1..max(ri) and copy it to b. For proccessing query with number i we should record to ari - 1..ri first or last(it depends on ti - 1) ri - 1 - ri + 1 elementes of b. After that this elements should be extract from b. You should remember that you need to sort subarray a1..rn, after last query.Time: Memeory: C++ Python3 631D - MessengerLet's define S[i] as i - th block of S, T[i] — as i - th block of T.Also S[l..r] = S[l]S[l + 1]...S[r] and T[l..r] = T[l]T[l + 1]...T[r].T is substring of S, if S[l + 1..r - 1] = T[2..m - 1] and S[l].l = T[1].l and S[l].c ≥ T[1].c and S[r].l = T[m].l and S[r].c ≥ T[m].c. Let's find all matches of T[l + 1..r - 1] in S and chose from this matches, witch is equal T.You can do this by Knuth–Morris–Pratt algorithm.This task has a some tricky test cases: and . Letters in the adjacent blocks are may be same.This problem can be solved by the union of adjacent blocks with same letter. and . Count of T blocks are less than 3. Such cases can be proccess singly. and . Answer for this test should be stored at long long. Time: Memory: C++Python3631E - Product SumThe operation, which has been described in the statement, is cyclic shift of some subarray. Let's try to solve this problem separately for left cyclic shift and for right cyclic shift. Let's define as answer before(or without) cyclic shift, Δans = ans - ans' — difference between answer after cyclic shift and before. This difference can be found by next formulas:For left cyclic shift:Δl, r = (al·r + al + 1·l + ... + ar·(r - 1)) - (al·l + al + 1·(l + 1) + ... + ar·r) = al·(r - l) - (al + 1 + al + 2 + ... + ar)For right cyclic shift:Δ'l, r = (al·(l + 1) + al + 1·(l + 2) + ... + ar·l) + (al·l + al + 1·(l + 1) + ... + ar·r) = (al + al + 1 + ... + ar - 1) + ar·(l - r)You can find this values with complexity , using prefix sums, .Let's try to rewrite previous formulas:For left cyclic shift: Δl, r = (al·r - sumr) + (suml - al·l)For right cyclic shift: Δ'l, r = (ar·l - suml - 1) + (sumr - 1 - ar·r)You can see, that if you fix l for left shift and r for right shift, you can solve this problem with complexity using Convex Hull Trick.Time: Memory: C++",

          "content": "631A - InterviewYou should know only one fact to solve this task: . This fact can be proved by the truth table. Let's use this fact: . Also . According two previous formulas we can get that f(a, 1, n) ≥ f(a, i, j). Finally we can get the answer. It's equal to f(a, 1, N) + f(b, 1, N).Time: Memory: C++ Python3 631B - Print CheckLet's define timeRi as a number of last query, wich repaint row with number i, timeCj – as number of last query, wich repaint column with number j. The value in cell (i, j) is equal amax(timeRi, timeCj).Time: Memory: C++ Python3631C - ReportIf we have some pair of queries that ri ≥ rj, i > j, then we can skip query with number j. Let's skip such queries. After that we get an array of sorted queries (ri ≤ rj, i > j). Let's sort subarray a1..max(ri) and copy it to b. For proccessing query with number i we should record to ari - 1..ri first or last(it depends on ti - 1) ri - 1 - ri + 1 elementes of b. After that this elements should be extract from b. You should remember that you need to sort subarray a1..rn, after last query.Time: Memeory: C++ Python3 631D - MessengerLet's define S[i] as i - th block of S, T[i] — as i - th block of T.Also S[l..r] = S[l]S[l + 1]...S[r] and T[l..r] = T[l]T[l + 1]...T[r].T is substring of S, if S[l + 1..r - 1] = T[2..m - 1] and S[l].l = T[1].l and S[l].c ≥ T[1].c and S[r].l = T[m].l and S[r].c ≥ T[m].c. Let's find all matches of T[l + 1..r - 1] in S and chose from this matches, witch is equal T.You can do this by Knuth–Morris–Pratt algorithm.This task has a some tricky test cases: and . Letters in the adjacent blocks are may be same.This problem can be solved by the union of adjacent blocks with same letter. and . Count of T blocks are less than 3. Such cases can be proccess singly. and . Answer for this test should be stored at long long. Time: Memory: C++Python3631E - Product SumThe operation, which has been described in the statement, is cyclic shift of some subarray. Let's try to solve this problem separately for left cyclic shift and for right cyclic shift. Let's define as answer before(or without) cyclic shift, Δans = ans - ans' — difference between answer after cyclic shift and before. This difference can be found by next formulas:For left cyclic shift:Δl, r = (al·r + al + 1·l + ... + ar·(r - 1)) - (al·l + al + 1·(l + 1) + ... + ar·r) = al·(r - l) - (al + 1 + al + 2 + ... + ar)For right cyclic shift:Δ'l, r = (al·(l + 1) + al + 1·(l + 2) + ... + ar·l) + (al·l + al + 1·(l + 1) + ... + ar·r) = (al + al + 1 + ... + ar - 1) + ar·(l - r)You can find this values with complexity , using prefix sums, .Let's try to rewrite previous formulas:For left cyclic shift: Δl, r = (al·r - sumr) + (suml - al·l)For right cyclic shift: Δ'l, r = (ar·l - suml - 1) + (sumr - 1 - ar·r)You can see, that if you fix l for left shift and r for right shift, you can solve this problem with complexity using Convex Hull Trick.Time: Memory: C++",

          "content": "632A - Grandma Laura and ApplesThe problem was suggested by unprost.Consider the process from the end. The last buyer will always buy a half of an apple and get a half for free (so the last string always is halfplus). After that each buyer increases the number of apples twice and also maybe by one. So we simply have the binary presentation of the number of apples from the end. To calculate the answer we should simply restore that value from the end and also calculate the total money grandma should have.С++ solution by me.С++ solution by unprost.Complexity: O(p).632B - Alice, Bob, Two TeamsThe problem was suggested by Lewin Gan Lewin.Let's calculate the prefix sums for all numbers (and store it in array s1) and for numbers with letter B (and store it in array s2). Now we can find the sum of all numbers in any segment in O(1) time and the sum of numbers with letter B.Let's iterate over prefix or suffix to flip and calculate the sum in that case by formulas: sum(s1, 0, n - 1) + sum(s2, 0, i) - 2·sum(s1, 0, i) for prefixes and sum(s1, 0, n - 1) + sum(s2, i, n - 1) - 2·sum(s1, i, n - 1) for suffixes.C++ solution by me.Python solution by Lewin.Complexity: O(n).632C - The Smallest String ConcatenationThe problem was suggested by Lewin Gan Lewin. The proof of the transitivity also belongs to him.Let's sort all the strings by comparator a + b < b + a and concatenate them. Let's prove that it's the optimal answer. Let that operator be transitive (so if ). Consider an optimal answer with two strings in reverse order by that operator. Because of the transitivity of operator we can assume that pair of strings are neighbouring. But then we can swap them and get the better answer.Let's prove the transitivity of operator. Consider the strings as the 26-base numbers. Then the relation a + b < b + a equivalent to . The last is simply the relation between real numbers. So we proved the transitivity of the relation a + b < b + a.C++ solution by me.Python solution by Lewin.Complexity: O(nLlogn), where L is the maximal string length.632D - Longest SubsequenceThe problem was suggested by Denis Bezrukov pitfall.Let cntx be the number of occurences of the number x in the given array (easy to see that we can ignore the numbers greater than m). Let's iterate over and 1 ≤ k, x·k ≤ m and increase the value in the position k·x in some array z by the value cntx. So the value zl equals the number of numbers in the given array which divide l. Let's find the minimal l with the maximum value zl (1 ≤ l ≤ m). Easy to see that the answer to the problem is the numbers which divide l.Let's calculate the complexity of the solution. The number of the pairs (k, x) we can bound with the value .C++ solution by me.Java solution by pitfall.Complexity: O(n + mlogm).632E - Thief in a ShopThe problem was suggested by Alexey Chesnokov CleRIC.Let k = 2, then it is the standard problem which can be solved by FFT (Fast Fourier Transform). The solution is the following: consider the polynomial which the i-th coefficient equals to one if and only if there is the number i in the given array. Let's multiply that polynomial by itself and find i for which the coefficient in square not equals to 0. Those values i will be in the answer. Easy to modificate the solution for the arbitrary k. We should simply calculate the k-th degree of the polynomial. The complexity will be WlogWlogk, where W is the maximal sum.We can improve that solution. Instead of calculating the k-th degree of the polynomial we can calculate the k-th degree of the DFT of the polynomial. The only problem is the large values of the k-th degrees. We can't use FFT with complex numbers, because of the precision problems. But we can do that with NTT (Number-theoretic transform). But that solution also has a problem. It can happen that some coefficients became equals to zero modulo p, but actually they are not equal to zero. To get round that problem we can choose two-three random modules and get the complexity O(W(logW + logk)).The main author solution has the complexity O(WlogWlogk) (FFT with complex numbers), the second solution has the same complexity, but uses NTT and the third solution has the improved complexity (but it was already hacked by halyavin).С++ solution, complex FFT by me.С++ solution, NTT by me.С++ solution, improved NTT by me.С++ solution by CleRIC.P.S.: To get faster solution you should each time multiply the polynomials of the required degree, but not of the degree 220.Complexity: O(WlogWlogk) or O(W(logW + logk)), depending the bravery of the coder :-)UPD: It turns out that the first approach also has complexity O(W(logW + logk)). See below the comment of halyavin.632F - Magic MatrixThe problem was suggested by Lewin Gan Lewin. The solution and proof also belongs to him.Consider the undirected complete graph with n nodes, with an edge between nodes i, j with cost aij. Let Bij denote the minimum possible value of the max edge of a path from i to j. We know that aij ≥ Bij by definition.If the matrix is magic, we can choose arbitrary k1, k2, ..., km such that aij ≤ max(ai, k1, ak1, k2, ..., akm, j) by repeating invocations of the inequality given. Also, you can show that if this inequality is satisfied, then the matrix is magic (by choosing an m = 1 and k1 arbitrary).So, this shows that the matrix is magic if and only if aij ≤ Bij. Thus, combining with aij ≥ Bij, we have aij = Bij.We need a fast way to compute Bij for all pairs i, j. This can be computed as the MST, as the path in the MST minimizes the max edge between all pairs of nodes. So, the algorithm works as follows. First, find the MST on the complete graph. Then, the matrix is magic if and only if the max edge on the path between i, j in the MST is exactly equal to ai, j. Also you shouldn't forget to check symmetry of the matrix and diagonal for zeros.P.S.: Unfortunately we couldn't increase the value n in this problem: the tests already had the size about 67MB and they couldn't be given with generator. So most of the users who solved this problem uses bitset-s. The complexity of their solution is , where b = 32 or b = 64.C++ solution, binary lifts by me.Java solution by Lewin.Complexity: O(n2logn) or O(n2).",

          "content": "632A - Grandma Laura and ApplesThe problem was suggested by unprost.Consider the process from the end. The last buyer will always buy a half of an apple and get a half for free (so the last string always is halfplus). After that each buyer increases the number of apples twice and also maybe by one. So we simply have the binary presentation of the number of apples from the end. To calculate the answer we should simply restore that value from the end and also calculate the total money grandma should have.С++ solution by me.С++ solution by unprost.Complexity: O(p).632B - Alice, Bob, Two TeamsThe problem was suggested by Lewin Gan Lewin.Let's calculate the prefix sums for all numbers (and store it in array s1) and for numbers with letter B (and store it in array s2). Now we can find the sum of all numbers in any segment in O(1) time and the sum of numbers with letter B.Let's iterate over prefix or suffix to flip and calculate the sum in that case by formulas: sum(s1, 0, n - 1) + sum(s2, 0, i) - 2·sum(s1, 0, i) for prefixes and sum(s1, 0, n - 1) + sum(s2, i, n - 1) - 2·sum(s1, i, n - 1) for suffixes.C++ solution by me.Python solution by Lewin.Complexity: O(n).632C - The Smallest String ConcatenationThe problem was suggested by Lewin Gan Lewin. The proof of the transitivity also belongs to him.Let's sort all the strings by comparator a + b < b + a and concatenate them. Let's prove that it's the optimal answer. Let that operator be transitive (so if ). Consider an optimal answer with two strings in reverse order by that operator. Because of the transitivity of operator we can assume that pair of strings are neighbouring. But then we can swap them and get the better answer.Let's prove the transitivity of operator. Consider the strings as the 26-base numbers. Then the relation a + b < b + a equivalent to . The last is simply the relation between real numbers. So we proved the transitivity of the relation a + b < b + a.C++ solution by me.Python solution by Lewin.Complexity: O(nLlogn), where L is the maximal string length.632D - Longest SubsequenceThe problem was suggested by Denis Bezrukov pitfall.Let cntx be the number of occurences of the number x in the given array (easy to see that we can ignore the numbers greater than m). Let's iterate over and 1 ≤ k, x·k ≤ m and increase the value in the position k·x in some array z by the value cntx. So the value zl equals the number of numbers in the given array which divide l. Let's find the minimal l with the maximum value zl (1 ≤ l ≤ m). Easy to see that the answer to the problem is the numbers which divide l.Let's calculate the complexity of the solution. The number of the pairs (k, x) we can bound with the value .C++ solution by me.Java solution by pitfall.Complexity: O(n + mlogm).632E - Thief in a ShopThe problem was suggested by Alexey Chesnokov CleRIC.Let k = 2, then it is the standard problem which can be solved by FFT (Fast Fourier Transform). The solution is the following: consider the polynomial which the i-th coefficient equals to one if and only if there is the number i in the given array. Let's multiply that polynomial by itself and find i for which the coefficient in square not equals to 0. Those values i will be in the answer. Easy to modificate the solution for the arbitrary k. We should simply calculate the k-th degree of the polynomial. The complexity will be WlogWlogk, where W is the maximal sum.We can improve that solution. Instead of calculating the k-th degree of the polynomial we can calculate the k-th degree of the DFT of the polynomial. The only problem is the large values of the k-th degrees. We can't use FFT with complex numbers, because of the precision problems. But we can do that with NTT (Number-theoretic transform). But that solution also has a problem. It can happen that some coefficients became equals to zero modulo p, but actually they are not equal to zero. To get round that problem we can choose two-three random modules and get the complexity O(W(logW + logk)).The main author solution has the complexity O(WlogWlogk) (FFT with complex numbers), the second solution has the same complexity, but uses NTT and the third solution has the improved complexity (but it was already hacked by halyavin).С++ solution, complex FFT by me.С++ solution, NTT by me.С++ solution, improved NTT by me.С++ solution by CleRIC.P.S.: To get faster solution you should each time multiply the polynomials of the required degree, but not of the degree 220.Complexity: O(WlogWlogk) or O(W(logW + logk)), depending the bravery of the coder :-)UPD: It turns out that the first approach also has complexity O(W(logW + logk)). See below the comment of halyavin.632F - Magic MatrixThe problem was suggested by Lewin Gan Lewin. The solution and proof also belongs to him.Consider the undirected complete graph with n nodes, with an edge between nodes i, j with cost aij. Let Bij denote the minimum possible value of the max edge of a path from i to j. We know that aij ≥ Bij by definition.If the matrix is magic, we can choose arbitrary k1, k2, ..., km such that aij ≤ max(ai, k1, ak1, k2, ..., akm, j) by repeating invocations of the inequality given. Also, you can show that if this inequality is satisfied, then the matrix is magic (by choosing an m = 1 and k1 arbitrary).So, this shows that the matrix is magic if and only if aij ≤ Bij. Thus, combining with aij ≥ Bij, we have aij = Bij.We need a fast way to compute Bij for all pairs i, j. This can be computed as the MST, as the path in the MST minimizes the max edge between all pairs of nodes. So, the algorithm works as follows. First, find the MST on the complete graph. Then, the matrix is magic if and only if the max edge on the path between i, j in the MST is exactly equal to ai, j. Also you shouldn't forget to check symmetry of the matrix and diagonal for zeros.P.S.: Unfortunately we couldn't increase the value n in this problem: the tests already had the size about 67MB and they couldn't be given with generator. So most of the users who solved this problem uses bitset-s. The complexity of their solution is , where b = 32 or b = 64.C++ solution, binary lifts by me.Java solution by Lewin.Complexity: O(n2logn) or O(n2).",

          "content": "632A - Бабушка Лаура и яблокиЗадача предложена пользователем unprost.Рассмотрим на процесс с конца. Последний покупатель всегда покупает половину яблока и половину получает бесплатно (поэтому последняя строка на самом деле всегда равна halfplus). Далее каждый покупатель удваивает текущее количество яблок и возможно прибавляет к нему единицу. Таким образом, нам просто задано бинарное представление числа записанное с конца. Для подсчёта ответа нужно просто с конца восстанавливать количество яблок попутно, вычисляя сумму денег.С++ solution by me.С++ solution by unprost.Сложность: O(p).632B - Алиса, Боб, две командыЗадача предложена пользователем Lewin Gan Lewin.Посчитаем частичные суммы на префиксах отдельно для всех чисел (в массиве s1) и отдельно для чисел напротив, которых стоит буква B (в массиве s2). Теперь мы можем за O(1) вычислять сумму на любом подотрезке, а также сумму на любом отрезке по числам напротив буквы B.Переберем теперь префикс или суффикс и посчитаем сумму в случае его изменения по формуле: sum(s1, 0, n - 1) + sum(s2, 0, i) - 2·sum(s1, 0, i) для префикса и sum(s1, 0, n - 1) + sum(s2, i, n - 1) - 2·sum(s1, i, n - 1) для суффикса.C++ solution by me.Python solution by Lewin.Сложность: O(n).632C - Наименьшая конкатенация строкЗадача предложена пользователем Lewin Gan Lewin. Доказательство транзитивности также принадлежит ему.Отсортируем все строки по компаратору a + b < b + a и сконкатенируем их в получившемся порядке. Докажем, что ответ оптимальный. Пусть эта операция транзитивна (то есть из ). Рассмотрим оптимальный ответ в котором есть пара строк, находящихся по этому отношению в обратном порядке. Поскольку это отношение транзитивно, то без потери общности можно считать, что это пара соседних строк. Но тогда мы их можем просто поменять местами и улучшить ответ.Докажем транзитивность отношения. Будем смотреть на эти строки как на числа в 26-ной системе счисления. Тогда отношения a + b < b + a эквивалентно . Последнее есть просто отношение для действительных чисел. Таким образом, мы доказали транзитивность отношения a + b < b + a.C++ solution by me.Python solution by Lewin.Сложность: O(nLlogn), где L — наибольшая длина строки.632D - Самая длинная подпоследовательностьЗадачу предложил Денис Безруков pitfall.Пусть cntx количество повторений числа x в заданном массиве (понятно, что числа большие m можно не рассматривать). Переберём и 1 ≤ k, x·k ≤ m и увеличим значение в позиции k·x в некотором массиве z на величину cntx. Таким образом, значение zl равно количеству чисел в исходном массиве делящих l. Найдём минимальное l с максимальным значением zl (1 ≤ l ≤ m). Легко видеть, что ответом на задачу будут числа делящие l.Оценим время работы решения. Количество пар (k, x) можно сверху оценить как .C++ solution by me.Java solution by pitfall.Сложность: O(n + mlogm).632E - Вор в магазинеЗадачу предложил Алексей Чесноков CleRIC.Пусть k = 2, тогда это стандартная задача которая может быть решена с помощью БПФ (быстрого преобразования Фурье). А решается она следующим образом: рассмотрим многочлен в которого коэффициент при i-й степени равен единице если и только если в заданном массиве есть число i. Возведём этот многочлен в квадрат, тогда те i коэффициент при которых в квадрате не равен 0 будут находиться в ответе. Легко обобщить это решение на случай произвольного k. Нужно просто исходный многочлен возвести в k-ю степень. Это, конечно, нужно сделать с помощью бинарного возведения в степень. Сложность получается O(WlogWlogk), где W — максимальная сумма.Заметим, что это решение можно улучшить. Зачем возводить в степень многочлен, когда можно возводить в степень его образ (то есть его ДПФ)? Единственное, что нас может остановить это то, что в случае комплексного БПФ будут получаться очень большие числа (порядка 1000-х степеней) и соответственно никакие вещественные типа нас не спасут). Но это можно сделать в целых числах используя теоретикочисловое преобразование Фурье (ТПФ). У этого решения есть проблема, что при преобразовании (прямом или обратном) какие-то коэффициенты могут случайно обнулиться по модулю простого из ТПФ, но на самом деле коэффициент не ноль. Это можно обойти случайным выбором простого (а лучше двух или трёх), чтобы никто не мог взломать решение. Таким образом, получаем сложность O(W(logW + logk)).Основное авторское решение было со сложностью O(WlogWlogk) с комплексным Фурье, второе с той же сложностью но по модулю, третье было с улучшенной асимптотикой (решение уже взломано Андреем Халявиным halyavin).С++ solution, complex FFT by me.С++ solution, NTT by me.С++ solution, improved NTT by me.С++ solution by CleRIC.P.S.: Чтобы решение было быстрым нужно каждый раз умножать многочлены нужной степени, а не степени 220.Сложность: O(WlogWlogk) или O(W(logW + logk)), в зависимости от смелости кодера :-)UPD: Оказывается первый подход тоже имеет сложность O(W(logW + logk)). Смотри ниже комментарий пользователя halyavin.632F - Волшебная матрицаЗадача предложена пользователем Lewin Gan Lewin. Решение и доказательство также принадлежат ему.Рассмотрим полный граф с весами рёбер aij. Обозначим Bij — минимальное значение максимального ребра на пути из вершины i в вершину j. Очевидно aij ≥ Bij по определение Bij.Если матрица волшебная мы можем выбрать произвольную последовательность k1, k2, ..., km и получить aij ≤ max{ai, k1, ak1, k2, ..., akm, j} (для этого нужно последовательно применить третье неравенство для волшебной матрицы). Также легко показать, что если это условие выполнено, то матрицы волшебная (нужно просто взять m = 1 и выбрать произвольное k1).Таким образом, мы получили, что матрица волшебная тогда и только тогда, когда aij ≤ Bij. Пользуясь неравенством aij ≥ Bij окончательно получаем ai, j = Bi, j.Теперь нам нужно быстрый способ подсчёта значений Bij для всех пар (i, j). Это можно сделать вычислым MST (минимальное покрывающее дерево графа), поскольку MST минимизирует максимальное ребро на путях между всеми парами вершин. Таким образом, решение выглядит следующим образом: сначала нужно найти MST (например, алгоритмом Прима за O(n2)), а затем нужно найти наибольшее ребро на пути из i в j и проверить, что оно равно aij (я это делал с помощью бинарного подъёма по дереву, но это можно делать во время построения MST). И, конечно, нужно не забыть предварительно проверить матрицу на симметричность и нули на диагонали.P.S.: К сожалению в этой задаче мы не могли увеличить n, поскольку тесты здесь очень специфические (и уже имели размер порядка 67MB) и генератором их задавать было нельзя. Большинство решений, которые сдали участники на контесте использует bitset-ы и работает за , где b = 32 или b = 64.C++ solution, binary lifts by me.Java solution by Lewin.Сложность: O(n2logn) или O(n2).",

Последний покупатель всегда покупает половину яблока и половину получает бесплатно (поэтому последняя строка на самом деле всегда равна halfplus). Далее каждый покупатель удваивает текущее количество яблок и возможно прибавляет к нему единицу. Таким образом, нам просто задано бинарное представление числа записанное с конца. Для подсчёта ответа нужно просто с конца восстанавливать количество яблок попутно, вычисляя сумму денег.С++ solution by me.С++ solution by unprost.Сложность: O(p).632B - Алиса, Боб, две командыЗадача предложена пользователем Lewin Gan Lewin.Посчитаем частичные суммы на префиксах отдельно для всех чисел (в массиве s1) и отдельно для чисел напротив, которых стоит буква B (в массиве s2). Теперь мы можем за O(1) вычислять сумму на любом подотрезке, а также сумму на любом отрезке по числам напротив буквы B.Переберем теперь префикс или суффикс и посчитаем сумму в случае его изменения по формуле: sum(s1, 0, n - 1) + sum(s2, 0, i) - 2·sum(s1, 0, i) для префикса и sum(s1, 0, n - 1) + sum(s2, i, n - 1) - 2·sum(s1, i, n - 1) для суффикса.C++ solution by me.Python solution by Lewin.Сложность: O(n).632C - Наименьшая конкатенация строкЗадача предложена пользователем Lewin Gan Lewin. Доказательство транзитивности также принадлежит ему.Отсортируем все строки по компаратору a + b < b + a и сконкатенируем их в получившемся порядке. Докажем, что ответ оптимальный. Пусть эта операция транзитивна (то есть из ). Рассмотрим оптимальный ответ в котором есть пара строк, находящихся по этому отношению в обратном порядке. Поскольку это отношение транзитивно, то без потери общности можно считать, что это пара соседних строк. Но тогда мы их можем просто поменять местами и улучшить ответ.Докажем транзитивность отношения. Будем смотреть на эти строки как на числа в 26-ной системе счисления. Тогда отношения a + b < b + a эквивалентно . Последнее есть просто отношение для действительных чисел. Таким образом, мы доказали транзитивность отношения a + b < b + a.C++ solution by me.Python solution by Lewin.Сложность: O(nLlogn), где L — наибольшая длина строки.632D - Самая длинная подпоследовательностьЗадачу предложил Денис Безруков pitfall.Пусть cntx количество повторений числа x в заданном массиве (понятно, что числа большие m можно не рассматривать). Переберём и 1 ≤ k, x·k ≤ m и увеличим значение в позиции k·x в некотором массиве z на величину cntx. Таким образом, значение zl равно количеству чисел в исходном массиве делящих l. Найдём минимальное l с максимальным значением zl (1 ≤ l ≤ m). Легко видеть, что ответом на задачу будут числа делящие l.Оценим время работы решения. Количество пар (k, x) можно сверху оценить как .C++ solution by me.Java solution by pitfall.Сложность: O(n + mlogm).632E - Вор в магазинеЗадачу предложил Алексей Чесноков CleRIC.Пусть k = 2, тогда это стандартная задача которая может быть решена с помощью БПФ (быстрого преобразования Фурье). А решается она следующим образом: рассмотрим многочлен в которого коэффициент при i-й степени равен единице если и только если в заданном массиве есть число i. Возведём этот многочлен в квадрат, тогда те i коэффициент при которых в квадрате не равен 0 будут находиться в ответе. Легко обобщить это решение на случай произвольного k. Нужно просто исходный многочлен возвести в k-ю степень. Это, конечно, нужно сделать с помощью бинарного возведения в степень. Сложность получается O(WlogWlogk), где W — максимальная сумма.Заметим, что это решение можно улучшить. Зачем возводить в степень многочлен, когда можно возводить в степень его образ (то есть его ДПФ)? Единственное, что нас может остановить это то, что в случае комплексного БПФ будут получаться очень большие числа (порядка 1000-х степеней) и соответственно никакие вещественные типа нас не спасут). Но это можно сделать в целых числах используя теоретикочисловое преобразование Фурье (ТПФ). У этого решения есть проблема, что при преобразовании (прямом или обратном) какие-то коэффициенты могут случайно обнулиться по модулю простого из ТПФ, но на самом деле коэффициент не ноль. Это можно обойти случайным выбором простого (а лучше двух или трёх), чтобы никто не мог взломать решение. Таким образом, получаем сложность O(W(logW + logk)).Основное авторское решение было со сложностью O(WlogWlogk) с комплексным Фурье, второе с той же сложностью но по модулю, третье было с улучшенной асимптотикой (решение уже взломано Андреем Халявиным halyavin).С++ solution, complex FFT by me.С++ solution, NTT by me.С++ solution, improved NTT by me.С++ solution by CleRIC.P.S.: Чтобы решение было быстрым нужно каждый раз умножать многочлены нужной степени, а не степени 220.Сложность: O(WlogWlogk) или O(W(logW + logk)), в зависимости от смелости кодера :-)UPD: Оказывается первый подход тоже имеет сложность O(W(logW + logk)). Смотри ниже комментарий пользователя halyavin.632F - Волшебная матрицаЗадача предложена пользователем Lewin Gan Lewin. Решение и доказательство также принадлежат ему.Рассмотрим полный граф с весами рёбер aij. Обозначим Bij — минимальное значение максимального ребра на пути из вершины i в вершину j. Очевидно aij ≥ Bij по определение Bij.Если матрица волшебная мы можем выбрать произвольную последовательность k1, k2, ..., km и получить aij ≤ max{ai, k1, ak1, k2, ..., akm, j} (для этого нужно последовательно применить третье неравенство для волшебной матрицы). Также легко показать, что если это условие выполнено, то матрицы волшебная (нужно просто взять m = 1 и выбрать произвольное k1).Таким образом, мы получили, что матрица волшебная тогда и только тогда, когда aij ≤ Bij. Пользуясь неравенством aij ≥ Bij окончательно получаем ai, j = Bi, j.Теперь нам нужно быстрый способ подсчёта значений Bij для всех пар (i, j). Это можно сделать вычислым MST (минимальное покрывающее дерево графа), поскольку MST минимизирует максимальное ребро на путях между всеми парами вершин. Таким образом, решение выглядит следующим образом: сначала нужно найти MST (например, алгоритмом Прима за O(n2)), а затем нужно найти наибольшее ребро на пути из i в j и проверить, что оно равно aij (я это делал с помощью бинарного подъёма по дереву, но это можно делать во время построения MST). И, конечно, нужно не забыть предварительно проверить матрицу на симметричность и нули на диагонали.P.S.: К сожалению в этой задаче мы не могли увеличить n, поскольку тесты здесь очень специфические (и уже имели размер порядка 67MB) и генератором их задавать было нельзя. Большинство решений, которые сдали участники на контесте использует bitset-ы и работает за , где b = 32 или b = 64.C++ solution, binary lifts by me.Java solution by Lewin.Сложность: O(n2logn) или O(n2).",

          "content": "632A - Grandma Laura and ApplesThe problem was suggested by unprost.Consider the process from the end. The last buyer will always buy a half of an apple and get a half for free (so the last string always is halfplus). After that each buyer increases the number of apples twice and also maybe by one. So we simply have the binary presentation of the number of apples from the end. To calculate the answer we should simply restore that value from the end and also calculate the total money grandma should have.С++ solution by me.С++ solution by unprost.Complexity: O(p).632B - Alice, Bob, Two TeamsThe problem was suggested by Lewin Gan Lewin.Let's calculate the prefix sums for all numbers (and store it in array s1) and for numbers with letter B (and store it in array s2). Now we can find the sum of all numbers in any segment in O(1) time and the sum of numbers with letter B.Let's iterate over prefix or suffix to flip and calculate the sum in that case by formulas: sum(s1, 0, n - 1) + sum(s2, 0, i) - 2·sum(s1, 0, i) for prefixes and sum(s1, 0, n - 1) + sum(s2, i, n - 1) - 2·sum(s1, i, n - 1) for suffixes.C++ solution by me.Python solution by Lewin.Complexity: O(n).632C - The Smallest String ConcatenationThe problem was suggested by Lewin Gan Lewin. The proof of the transitivity also belongs to him.Let's sort all the strings by comparator a + b < b + a and concatenate them. Let's prove that it's the optimal answer. Let that operator be transitive (so if ). Consider an optimal answer with two strings in reverse order by that operator. Because of the transitivity of operator we can assume that pair of strings are neighbouring. But then we can swap them and get the better answer.Let's prove the transitivity of operator. Consider the strings as the 26-base numbers. Then the relation a + b < b + a equivalent to . The last is simply the relation between real numbers. So we proved the transitivity of the relation a + b < b + a.C++ solution by me.Python solution by Lewin.Complexity: O(nLlogn), where L is the maximal string length.632D - Longest SubsequenceThe problem was suggested by Denis Bezrukov pitfall.Let cntx be the number of occurences of the number x in the given array (easy to see that we can ignore the numbers greater than m). Let's iterate over and 1 ≤ k, x·k ≤ m and increase the value in the position k·x in some array z by the value cntx. So the value zl equals the number of numbers in the given array which divide l. Let's find the minimal l with the maximum value zl (1 ≤ l ≤ m). Easy to see that the answer to the problem is the numbers which divide l.Let's calculate the complexity of the solution. The number of the pairs (k, x) we can bound with the value .C++ solution by me.Java solution by pitfall.Complexity: O(n + mlogm).632E - Thief in a ShopThe problem was suggested by Alexey Chesnokov CleRIC.Let k = 2, then it is the standard problem which can be solved by FFT (Fast Fourier Transform). The solution is the following: consider the polynomial which the i-th coefficient equals to one if and only if there is the number i in the given array. Let's multiply that polynomial by itself and find i for which the coefficient in square not equals to 0. Those values i will be in the answer. Easy to modificate the solution for the arbitrary k. We should simply calculate the k-th degree of the polynomial. The complexity will be WlogWlogk, where W is the maximal sum.We can improve that solution. Instead of calculating the k-th degree of the polynomial we can calculate the k-th degree of the DFT of the polynomial. The only problem is the large values of the k-th degrees. We can't use FFT with complex numbers, because of the precision problems. But we can do that with NTT (Number-theoretic transform). But that solution also has a problem. It can happen that some coefficients became equals to zero modulo p, but actually they are not equal to zero. To get round that problem we can choose two-three random modules and get the complexity O(W(logW + logk)).The main author solution has the complexity O(WlogWlogk) (FFT with complex numbers), the second solution has the same complexity, but uses NTT and the third solution has the improved complexity (but it was already hacked by halyavin).С++ solution, complex FFT by me.С++ solution, NTT by me.С++ solution, improved NTT by me.С++ solution by CleRIC.P.S.: To get faster solution you should each time multiply the polynomials of the required degree, but not of the degree 220.Complexity: O(WlogWlogk) or O(W(logW + logk)), depending the bravery of the coder :-)UPD: It turns out that the first approach also has complexity O(W(logW + logk)). See below the comment of halyavin.632F - Magic MatrixThe problem was suggested by Lewin Gan Lewin. The solution and proof also belongs to him.Consider the undirected complete graph with n nodes, with an edge between nodes i, j with cost aij. Let Bij denote the minimum possible value of the max edge of a path from i to j. We know that aij ≥ Bij by definition.If the matrix is magic, we can choose arbitrary k1, k2, ..., km such that aij ≤ max(ai, k1, ak1, k2, ..., akm, j) by repeating invocations of the inequality given. Also, you can show that if this inequality is satisfied, then the matrix is magic (by choosing an m = 1 and k1 arbitrary).So, this shows that the matrix is magic if and only if aij ≤ Bij. Thus, combining with aij ≥ Bij, we have aij = Bij.We need a fast way to compute Bij for all pairs i, j. This can be computed as the MST, as the path in the MST minimizes the max edge between all pairs of nodes. So, the algorithm works as follows. First, find the MST on the complete graph. Then, the matrix is magic if and only if the max edge on the path between i, j in the MST is exactly equal to ai, j. Also you shouldn't forget to check symmetry of the matrix and diagonal for zeros.P.S.: Unfortunately we couldn't increase the value n in this problem: the tests already had the size about 67MB and they couldn't be given with generator. So most of the users who solved this problem uses bitset-s. The complexity of their solution is , where b = 32 or b = 64.C++ solution, binary lifts by me.Java solution by Lewin.Complexity: O(n2logn) or O(n2).",

The last buyer will always buy a half of an apple and get a half for free (so the last string always is halfplus). After that each buyer increases the number of apples twice and also maybe by one. So we simply have the binary presentation of the number of apples from the end. To calculate the answer we should simply restore that value from the end and also calculate the total money grandma should have.С++ solution by me.С++ solution by unprost.Complexity: O(p).632B - Alice, Bob, Two TeamsThe problem was suggested by Lewin Gan Lewin.Let's calculate the prefix sums for all numbers (and store it in array s1) and for numbers with letter B (and store it in array s2). Now we can find the sum of all numbers in any segment in O(1) time and the sum of numbers with letter B.Let's iterate over prefix or suffix to flip and calculate the sum in that case by formulas: sum(s1, 0, n - 1) + sum(s2, 0, i) - 2·sum(s1, 0, i) for prefixes and sum(s1, 0, n - 1) + sum(s2, i, n - 1) - 2·sum(s1, i, n - 1) for suffixes.C++ solution by me.Python solution by Lewin.Complexity: O(n).632C - The Smallest String ConcatenationThe problem was suggested by Lewin Gan Lewin. The proof of the transitivity also belongs to him.Let's sort all the strings by comparator a + b < b + a and concatenate them. Let's prove that it's the optimal answer. Let that operator be transitive (so if ). Consider an optimal answer with two strings in reverse order by that operator. Because of the transitivity of operator we can assume that pair of strings are neighbouring. But then we can swap them and get the better answer.Let's prove the transitivity of operator. Consider the strings as the 26-base numbers. Then the relation a + b < b + a equivalent to . The last is simply the relation between real numbers. So we proved the transitivity of the relation a + b < b + a.C++ solution by me.Python solution by Lewin.Complexity: O(nLlogn), where L is the maximal string length.632D - Longest SubsequenceThe problem was suggested by Denis Bezrukov pitfall.Let cntx be the number of occurences of the number x in the given array (easy to see that we can ignore the numbers greater than m). Let's iterate over and 1 ≤ k, x·k ≤ m and increase the value in the position k·x in some array z by the value cntx. So the value zl equals the number of numbers in the given array which divide l. Let's find the minimal l with the maximum value zl (1 ≤ l ≤ m). Easy to see that the answer to the problem is the numbers which divide l.Let's calculate the complexity of the solution. The number of the pairs (k, x) we can bound with the value .C++ solution by me.Java solution by pitfall.Complexity: O(n + mlogm).632E - Thief in a ShopThe problem was suggested by Alexey Chesnokov CleRIC.Let k = 2, then it is the standard problem which can be solved by FFT (Fast Fourier Transform). The solution is the following: consider the polynomial which the i-th coefficient equals to one if and only if there is the number i in the given array. Let's multiply that polynomial by itself and find i for which the coefficient in square not equals to 0. Those values i will be in the answer. Easy to modificate the solution for the arbitrary k. We should simply calculate the k-th degree of the polynomial. The complexity will be WlogWlogk, where W is the maximal sum.We can improve that solution. Instead of calculating the k-th degree of the polynomial we can calculate the k-th degree of the DFT of the polynomial. The only problem is the large values of the k-th degrees. We can't use FFT with complex numbers, because of the precision problems. But we can do that with NTT (Number-theoretic transform). But that solution also has a problem. It can happen that some coefficients became equals to zero modulo p, but actually they are not equal to zero. To get round that problem we can choose two-three random modules and get the complexity O(W(logW + logk)).The main author solution has the complexity O(WlogWlogk) (FFT with complex numbers), the second solution has the same complexity, but uses NTT and the third solution has the improved complexity (but it was already hacked by halyavin).С++ solution, complex FFT by me.С++ solution, NTT by me.С++ solution, improved NTT by me.С++ solution by CleRIC.P.S.: To get faster solution you should each time multiply the polynomials of the required degree, but not of the degree 220.Complexity: O(WlogWlogk) or O(W(logW + logk)), depending the bravery of the coder :-)UPD: It turns out that the first approach also has complexity O(W(logW + logk)). See below the comment of halyavin.632F - Magic MatrixThe problem was suggested by Lewin Gan Lewin. The solution and proof also belongs to him.Consider the undirected complete graph with n nodes, with an edge between nodes i, j with cost aij. Let Bij denote the minimum possible value of the max edge of a path from i to j. We know that aij ≥ Bij by definition.If the matrix is magic, we can choose arbitrary k1, k2, ..., km such that aij ≤ max(ai, k1, ak1, k2, ..., akm, j) by repeating invocations of the inequality given. Also, you can show that if this inequality is satisfied, then the matrix is magic (by choosing an m = 1 and k1 arbitrary).So, this shows that the matrix is magic if and only if aij ≤ Bij. Thus, combining with aij ≥ Bij, we have aij = Bij.We need a fast way to compute Bij for all pairs i, j. This can be computed as the MST, as the path in the MST minimizes the max edge between all pairs of nodes. So, the algorithm works as follows. First, find the MST on the complete graph. Then, the matrix is magic if and only if the max edge on the path between i, j in the MST is exactly equal to ai, j. Also you shouldn't forget to check symmetry of the matrix and diagonal for zeros.P.S.: Unfortunately we couldn't increase the value n in this problem: the tests already had the size about 67MB and they couldn't be given with generator. So most of the users who solved this problem uses bitset-s. The complexity of their solution is , where b = 32 or b = 64.C++ solution, binary lifts by me.Java solution by Lewin.Complexity: O(n2logn) or O(n2).",

          "content": "Problem A: Ebony IvoryThe problem is to find if there exists a solution to the equation: ax + by = c where x and y are both positive integers. The limits are small enough to try all values of x and correspondingly try if such a y exists. The question can also be solved more efficiently using the fact that an integral solution to this problem exists iff gcd(a, b)|c. We just have to make one more check to ensure a positive integral solution.Complexity: O(log(min(a, b))Problem B: A Trivial ProblemWe know how to calculate number of zeros in the factorial of a number. For finding the range of numbers having number of zeros equal to a constant, we can use binary search. Though, the limits are small enough to try and find the number of zeros in factorial of all numbers of the given range.Complexity: O(log(n)2)Problem C: Spy Syndrome 2The given encrypted string can be reversed initially. Then dp[i] can be defined as the index at which the next word should start such that the given string can be formed using the given dictionary. Rabin Karp hashing can be used to compute dp[i] efficiently.Also, care must be taken that in the answer the words have to be printed in the correct casing as they appear in the dictionary.Complexity: O(n * w) where n is the length of the encrypted string, w is the maximum length of any word in the dictionary.Problem D: Fibonacci-ishThe key to the solution is that the complete Fibonacci-ish sequence is determined by the first two terms. Another thing to note is that for the given constraints on a[i], the length of the Fibonacci-ish sequence is of logarithmic order (the longest sequence possible under current constraints was of length~90) except for the case where a[i] = a[j] = 0, where the length can become as long as the length of the given sequence. Thus, the case for 0 has to be handled separately.Complexity: O(n * n * l) where n is the length of the given sequence and l is the length of the longest Fibonacci-ish subsequence.Problem E: Startup fundingLet us denote the number of visitors in the ith week by v[i] and the revenue in the ith week by r[i].Let us define z[i] = max(min( 100 * max(v[i...j]), min(c[i...j]))) for all (j >  = i). Note that max(v[i...j]) is an increasing function in j and min(r[i...j]) is a decreasing function in j. Thus, for all i, z[i] can be computed using RMQ sparse table in combination with binary search.Thus the question reduces to selecting k values randomly from the array z. Let us suppose we select these k values and call the minimum of these values x. Now, x is the random variable whose expected value we need to find. If we sort z in non-decreasing order:E(X) = (z[1] * C(n - 1, k - 1) + z[2] * C(n - 2, k - 1) + z[3] * C(n - 3, k - 1)....) / (C(n, k))where C(n, k) is the number of ways of selecting k objects out of n. Since C(n, k) will be big values, we should not compute C(n, k) explicitly and just write them as ratios of the previous terms. Example: C(n - 1, k - 1) / C(n, k) = k / n and so on.Complexity: O(n * lgn)Problem F: The Chocolate SpreeThe problem boils down to computing the maximum sum of two disjoint weighted paths in a tree (weight is on the nodes not edges). It can be solved applying DP as in the given solution : http://pastebin.com/L8NNLF3f (Thanks to GlebsHP for the solution!)Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the tree.Problem G: Yash and TreesPerform an euler tour (basically a post/pre order traversal) of the tree and store it as an array. Now, the nodes of the subtree are stored are part of the array as a subarray (contiguous subsequence). Query Type 2 requires you to essentially answer the number of nodes in the subtree such that their value modulo m is a prime. Since, m ≤ 1000, we can build a segment tree(with lazy propagation) where each node has a bitset, say b where b[i] is on iff a value x exists in the segment represented by that node, such that . The addition operations then are simply reduced to bit-rotation within the bitset of the node.Complexity: O(n * lgn * f), where n is the cardinality of the vertices of the tree, f is a small factor denoting the time required for conducting bit rotations on a bitset of size 1000. Problem H: Fibonacci-ish IIThe problem can be solved by taking the queries offline and using a square-root decomposition trick popularly called as “Mo’s algorithm”. Apart from that, segment tree(with lazy propagation) has to be maintained for the Fibonacci-ish potential of the elements in the current [l,r] range. The fact used in the segment tree for lazy propagation is:F(k + 1) * (a1 * F(i) + a2 * F(i + 1)...) + F(k) * (a1 * F(i - 1) + a2 * F(i) + ....) = (a1 * F(i + k) + a2 * F(i + k + 1)....)Example: Suppose currently the array is [100,400,500,100,300]. Using Mo's algorithm, currently the segment tree is configured for the answer of the segment [3,5]. The segment tree' node [4,5] will store answer=500*F(2)=1000. In general, the node [l1, r1] of segment tree will contain answer for the values in the current range of [l2, r2] of Mo's for the values that have rank in sorted array [l1, r1]. The answer will thus be of the form a1 * F(i) + a2 * F(i + 1).... We maintain an invariant that apart from the answer, it will also store answer for one step back in Fibonacci, i.e., a1 * F(i - 1) + a2 * F(i).... Now, when values are added (or removed) in the segment tree, the segments after the point after which the value is added have to be updated. For this we maintain a lazy count parameter (say k). Thus, when we remove the laziness of the node, we use the above stated formula to remove the laziness in O(1) time. Refer our implementation for details: http://pastebin.com/MbQYtReXComplexity:",

          "content": "Problem A: Ebony IvoryThe problem is to find if there exists a solution to the equation: ax + by = c where x and y are both positive integers. The limits are small enough to try all values of x and correspondingly try if such a y exists. The question can also be solved more efficiently using the fact that an integral solution to this problem exists iff gcd(a, b)|c. We just have to make one more check to ensure a positive integral solution.Complexity: O(log(min(a, b))Problem B: A Trivial ProblemWe know how to calculate number of zeros in the factorial of a number. For finding the range of numbers having number of zeros equal to a constant, we can use binary search. Though, the limits are small enough to try and find the number of zeros in factorial of all numbers of the given range.Complexity: O(log(n)2)Problem C: Spy Syndrome 2The given encrypted string can be reversed initially. Then dp[i] can be defined as the index at which the next word should start such that the given string can be formed using the given dictionary. Rabin Karp hashing can be used to compute dp[i] efficiently.Also, care must be taken that in the answer the words have to be printed in the correct casing as they appear in the dictionary.Complexity: O(n * w) where n is the length of the encrypted string, w is the maximum length of any word in the dictionary.Problem D: Fibonacci-ishThe key to the solution is that the complete Fibonacci-ish sequence is determined by the first two terms. Another thing to note is that for the given constraints on a[i], the length of the Fibonacci-ish sequence is of logarithmic order (the longest sequence possible under current constraints was of length~90) except for the case where a[i] = a[j] = 0, where the length can become as long as the length of the given sequence. Thus, the case for 0 has to be handled separately.Complexity: O(n * n * l) where n is the length of the given sequence and l is the length of the longest Fibonacci-ish subsequence.Problem E: Startup fundingLet us denote the number of visitors in the ith week by v[i] and the revenue in the ith week by r[i].Let us define z[i] = max(min( 100 * max(v[i...j]), min(c[i...j]))) for all (j >  = i). Note that max(v[i...j]) is an increasing function in j and min(r[i...j]) is a decreasing function in j. Thus, for all i, z[i] can be computed using RMQ sparse table in combination with binary search.Thus the question reduces to selecting k values randomly from the array z. Let us suppose we select these k values and call the minimum of these values x. Now, x is the random variable whose expected value we need to find. If we sort z in non-decreasing order:E(X) = (z[1] * C(n - 1, k - 1) + z[2] * C(n - 2, k - 1) + z[3] * C(n - 3, k - 1)....) / (C(n, k))where C(n, k) is the number of ways of selecting k objects out of n. Since C(n, k) will be big values, we should not compute C(n, k) explicitly and just write them as ratios of the previous terms. Example: C(n - 1, k - 1) / C(n, k) = k / n and so on.Complexity: O(n * lgn)Problem F: The Chocolate SpreeThe problem boils down to computing the maximum sum of two disjoint weighted paths in a tree (weight is on the nodes not edges). It can be solved applying DP as in the given solution : http://pastebin.com/L8NNLF3f (Thanks to GlebsHP for the solution!)Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the tree.Problem G: Yash and TreesPerform an euler tour (basically a post/pre order traversal) of the tree and store it as an array. Now, the nodes of the subtree are stored are part of the array as a subarray (contiguous subsequence). Query Type 2 requires you to essentially answer the number of nodes in the subtree such that their value modulo m is a prime. Since, m ≤ 1000, we can build a segment tree(with lazy propagation) where each node has a bitset, say b where b[i] is on iff a value x exists in the segment represented by that node, such that . The addition operations then are simply reduced to bit-rotation within the bitset of the node.Complexity: O(n * lgn * f), where n is the cardinality of the vertices of the tree, f is a small factor denoting the time required for conducting bit rotations on a bitset of size 1000. Problem H: Fibonacci-ish IIThe problem can be solved by taking the queries offline and using a square-root decomposition trick popularly called as “Mo’s algorithm”. Apart from that, segment tree(with lazy propagation) has to be maintained for the Fibonacci-ish potential of the elements in the current [l,r] range. The fact used in the segment tree for lazy propagation is:F(k + 1) * (a1 * F(i) + a2 * F(i + 1)...) + F(k) * (a1 * F(i - 1) + a2 * F(i) + ....) = (a1 * F(i + k) + a2 * F(i + k + 1)....)Example: Suppose currently the array is [100,400,500,100,300]. Using Mo's algorithm, currently the segment tree is configured for the answer of the segment [3,5]. The segment tree' node [4,5] will store answer=500*F(2)=1000. In general, the node [l1, r1] of segment tree will contain answer for the values in the current range of [l2, r2] of Mo's for the values that have rank in sorted array [l1, r1]. The answer will thus be of the form a1 * F(i) + a2 * F(i + 1).... We maintain an invariant that apart from the answer, it will also store answer for one step back in Fibonacci, i.e., a1 * F(i - 1) + a2 * F(i).... Now, when values are added (or removed) in the segment tree, the segments after the point after which the value is added have to be updated. For this we maintain a lazy count parameter (say k). Thus, when we remove the laziness of the node, we use the above stated formula to remove the laziness in O(1) time. Refer our implementation for details: http://pastebin.com/MbQYtReXComplexity:",

          "content": "Problem A: Ebony IvoryThe problem is to find if there exists a solution to the equation: ax + by = c where x and y are both positive integers. The limits are small enough to try all values of x and correspondingly try if such a y exists. The question can also be solved more efficiently using the fact that an integral solution to this problem exists iff gcd(a, b)|c. We just have to make one more check to ensure a positive integral solution.Complexity: O(log(min(a, b))Problem B: A Trivial ProblemWe know how to calculate number of zeros in the factorial of a number. For finding the range of numbers having number of zeros equal to a constant, we can use binary search. Though, the limits are small enough to try and find the number of zeros in factorial of all numbers of the given range.Complexity: O(log(n)2)Problem C: Spy Syndrome 2The given encrypted string can be reversed initially. Then dp[i] can be defined as the index at which the next word should start such that the given string can be formed using the given dictionary. Rabin Karp hashing can be used to compute dp[i] efficiently.Also, care must be taken that in the answer the words have to be printed in the correct casing as they appear in the dictionary.Complexity: O(n * w) where n is the length of the encrypted string, w is the maximum length of any word in the dictionary.Problem D: Fibonacci-ishThe key to the solution is that the complete Fibonacci-ish sequence is determined by the first two terms. Another thing to note is that for the given constraints on a[i], the length of the Fibonacci-ish sequence is of logarithmic order (the longest sequence possible under current constraints was of length~90) except for the case where a[i] = a[j] = 0, where the length can become as long as the length of the given sequence. Thus, the case for 0 has to be handled separately.Complexity: O(n * n * l) where n is the length of the given sequence and l is the length of the longest Fibonacci-ish subsequence.Problem E: Startup fundingLet us denote the number of visitors in the ith week by v[i] and the revenue in the ith week by r[i].Let us define z[i] = max(min( 100 * max(v[i...j]), min(c[i...j]))) for all (j >  = i). Note that max(v[i...j]) is an increasing function in j and min(r[i...j]) is a decreasing function in j. Thus, for all i, z[i] can be computed using RMQ sparse table in combination with binary search.Thus the question reduces to selecting k values randomly from the array z. Let us suppose we select these k values and call the minimum of these values x. Now, x is the random variable whose expected value we need to find. If we sort z in non-decreasing order:E(X) = (z[1] * C(n - 1, k - 1) + z[2] * C(n - 2, k - 1) + z[3] * C(n - 3, k - 1)....) / (C(n, k))where C(n, k) is the number of ways of selecting k objects out of n. Since C(n, k) will be big values, we should not compute C(n, k) explicitly and just write them as ratios of the previous terms. Example: C(n - 1, k - 1) / C(n, k) = k / n and so on.Complexity: O(n * lgn)Problem F: The Chocolate SpreeThe problem boils down to computing the maximum sum of two disjoint weighted paths in a tree (weight is on the nodes not edges). It can be solved applying DP as in the given solution : http://pastebin.com/L8NNLF3f (Thanks to GlebsHP for the solution!)Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the tree.Problem G: Yash and TreesPerform an euler tour (basically a post/pre order traversal) of the tree and store it as an array. Now, the nodes of the subtree are stored are part of the array as a subarray (contiguous subsequence). Query Type 2 requires you to essentially answer the number of nodes in the subtree such that their value modulo m is a prime. Since, m ≤ 1000, we can build a segment tree(with lazy propagation) where each node has a bitset, say b where b[i] is on iff a value x exists in the segment represented by that node, such that . The addition operations then are simply reduced to bit-rotation within the bitset of the node.Complexity: O(n * lgn * f), where n is the cardinality of the vertices of the tree, f is a small factor denoting the time required for conducting bit rotations on a bitset of size 1000. Problem H: Fibonacci-ish IIThe problem can be solved by taking the queries offline and using a square-root decomposition trick popularly called as “Mo’s algorithm”. Apart from that, segment tree(with lazy propagation) has to be maintained for the Fibonacci-ish potential of the elements in the current [l,r] range. The fact used in the segment tree for lazy propagation is:F(k + 1) * (a1 * F(i) + a2 * F(i + 1)...) + F(k) * (a1 * F(i - 1) + a2 * F(i) + ....) = (a1 * F(i + k) + a2 * F(i + k + 1)....)Example: Suppose currently the array is [100,400,500,100,300]. Using Mo's algorithm, currently the segment tree is configured for the answer of the segment [3,5]. The segment tree' node [4,5] will store answer=500*F(2)=1000. In general, the node [l1, r1] of segment tree will contain answer for the values in the current range of [l2, r2] of Mo's for the values that have rank in sorted array [l1, r1]. The answer will thus be of the form a1 * F(i) + a2 * F(i + 1).... We maintain an invariant that apart from the answer, it will also store answer for one step back in Fibonacci, i.e., a1 * F(i - 1) + a2 * F(i).... Now, when values are added (or removed) in the segment tree, the segments after the point after which the value is added have to be updated. For this we maintain a lazy count parameter (say k). Thus, when we remove the laziness of the node, we use the above stated formula to remove the laziness in O(1) time. Refer our implementation for details: http://pastebin.com/MbQYtReXComplexity:",

          "content": "Problem A: Ebony IvoryThe problem is to find if there exists a solution to the equation: ax + by = c where x and y are both positive integers. The limits are small enough to try all values of x and correspondingly try if such a y exists. The question can also be solved more efficiently using the fact that an integral solution to this problem exists iff gcd(a, b)|c. We just have to make one more check to ensure a positive integral solution.Complexity: O(log(min(a, b))Problem B: A Trivial ProblemWe know how to calculate number of zeros in the factorial of a number. For finding the range of numbers having number of zeros equal to a constant, we can use binary search. Though, the limits are small enough to try and find the number of zeros in factorial of all numbers of the given range.Complexity: O(log(n)2)Problem C: Spy Syndrome 2The given encrypted string can be reversed initially. Then dp[i] can be defined as the index at which the next word should start such that the given string can be formed using the given dictionary. Rabin Karp hashing can be used to compute dp[i] efficiently.Also, care must be taken that in the answer the words have to be printed in the correct casing as they appear in the dictionary.Complexity: O(n * w) where n is the length of the encrypted string, w is the maximum length of any word in the dictionary.Problem D: Fibonacci-ishThe key to the solution is that the complete Fibonacci-ish sequence is determined by the first two terms. Another thing to note is that for the given constraints on a[i], the length of the Fibonacci-ish sequence is of logarithmic order (the longest sequence possible under current constraints was of length~90) except for the case where a[i] = a[j] = 0, where the length can become as long as the length of the given sequence. Thus, the case for 0 has to be handled separately.Complexity: O(n * n * l) where n is the length of the given sequence and l is the length of the longest Fibonacci-ish subsequence.Problem E: Startup fundingLet us denote the number of visitors in the ith week by v[i] and the revenue in the ith week by r[i].Let us define z[i] = max(min( 100 * max(v[i...j]), min(c[i...j]))) for all (j >  = i). Note that max(v[i...j]) is an increasing function in j and min(r[i...j]) is a decreasing function in j. Thus, for all i, z[i] can be computed using RMQ sparse table in combination with binary search.Thus the question reduces to selecting k values randomly from the array z. Let us suppose we select these k values and call the minimum of these values x. Now, x is the random variable whose expected value we need to find. If we sort z in non-decreasing order:E(X) = (z[1] * C(n - 1, k - 1) + z[2] * C(n - 2, k - 1) + z[3] * C(n - 3, k - 1)....) / (C(n, k))where C(n, k) is the number of ways of selecting k objects out of n. Since C(n, k) will be big values, we should not compute C(n, k) explicitly and just write them as ratios of the previous terms. Example: C(n - 1, k - 1) / C(n, k) = k / n and so on.Complexity: O(n * lgn)Problem F: The Chocolate SpreeThe problem boils down to computing the maximum sum of two disjoint weighted paths in a tree (weight is on the nodes not edges). It can be solved applying DP as in the given solution : http://pastebin.com/L8NNLF3f (Thanks to GlebsHP for the solution!)Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the tree.Problem G: Yash and TreesPerform an euler tour (basically a post/pre order traversal) of the tree and store it as an array. Now, the nodes of the subtree are stored are part of the array as a subarray (contiguous subsequence). Query Type 2 requires you to essentially answer the number of nodes in the subtree such that their value modulo m is a prime. Since, m ≤ 1000, we can build a segment tree(with lazy propagation) where each node has a bitset, say b where b[i] is on iff a value x exists in the segment represented by that node, such that . The addition operations then are simply reduced to bit-rotation within the bitset of the node.Complexity: O(n * lgn * f), where n is the cardinality of the vertices of the tree, f is a small factor denoting the time required for conducting bit rotations on a bitset of size 1000. Problem H: Fibonacci-ish IIThe problem can be solved by taking the queries offline and using a square-root decomposition trick popularly called as “Mo’s algorithm”. Apart from that, segment tree(with lazy propagation) has to be maintained for the Fibonacci-ish potential of the elements in the current [l,r] range. The fact used in the segment tree for lazy propagation is:F(k + 1) * (a1 * F(i) + a2 * F(i + 1)...) + F(k) * (a1 * F(i - 1) + a2 * F(i) + ....) = (a1 * F(i + k) + a2 * F(i + k + 1)....)Example: Suppose currently the array is [100,400,500,100,300]. Using Mo's algorithm, currently the segment tree is configured for the answer of the segment [3,5]. The segment tree' node [4,5] will store answer=500*F(2)=1000. In general, the node [l1, r1] of segment tree will contain answer for the values in the current range of [l2, r2] of Mo's for the values that have rank in sorted array [l1, r1]. The answer will thus be of the form a1 * F(i) + a2 * F(i + 1).... We maintain an invariant that apart from the answer, it will also store answer for one step back in Fibonacci, i.e., a1 * F(i - 1) + a2 * F(i).... Now, when values are added (or removed) in the segment tree, the segments after the point after which the value is added have to be updated. For this we maintain a lazy count parameter (say k). Thus, when we remove the laziness of the node, we use the above stated formula to remove the laziness in O(1) time. Refer our implementation for details: http://pastebin.com/MbQYtReXComplexity:",

          "content": "Problem A: Ebony IvoryThe problem is to find if there exists a solution to the equation: ax + by = c where x and y are both positive integers. The limits are small enough to try all values of x and correspondingly try if such a y exists. The question can also be solved more efficiently using the fact that an integral solution to this problem exists iff gcd(a, b)|c. We just have to make one more check to ensure a positive integral solution.Complexity: O(log(min(a, b))Problem B: A Trivial ProblemWe know how to calculate number of zeros in the factorial of a number. For finding the range of numbers having number of zeros equal to a constant, we can use binary search. Though, the limits are small enough to try and find the number of zeros in factorial of all numbers of the given range.Complexity: O(log(n)2)Problem C: Spy Syndrome 2The given encrypted string can be reversed initially. Then dp[i] can be defined as the index at which the next word should start such that the given string can be formed using the given dictionary. Rabin Karp hashing can be used to compute dp[i] efficiently.Also, care must be taken that in the answer the words have to be printed in the correct casing as they appear in the dictionary.Complexity: O(n * w) where n is the length of the encrypted string, w is the maximum length of any word in the dictionary.Problem D: Fibonacci-ishThe key to the solution is that the complete Fibonacci-ish sequence is determined by the first two terms. Another thing to note is that for the given constraints on a[i], the length of the Fibonacci-ish sequence is of logarithmic order (the longest sequence possible under current constraints was of length~90) except for the case where a[i] = a[j] = 0, where the length can become as long as the length of the given sequence. Thus, the case for 0 has to be handled separately.Complexity: O(n * n * l) where n is the length of the given sequence and l is the length of the longest Fibonacci-ish subsequence.Problem E: Startup fundingLet us denote the number of visitors in the ith week by v[i] and the revenue in the ith week by r[i].Let us define z[i] = max(min( 100 * max(v[i...j]), min(c[i...j]))) for all (j >  = i). Note that max(v[i...j]) is an increasing function in j and min(r[i...j]) is a decreasing function in j. Thus, for all i, z[i] can be computed using RMQ sparse table in combination with binary search.Thus the question reduces to selecting k values randomly from the array z. Let us suppose we select these k values and call the minimum of these values x. Now, x is the random variable whose expected value we need to find. If we sort z in non-decreasing order:E(X) = (z[1] * C(n - 1, k - 1) + z[2] * C(n - 2, k - 1) + z[3] * C(n - 3, k - 1)....) / (C(n, k))where C(n, k) is the number of ways of selecting k objects out of n. Since C(n, k) will be big values, we should not compute C(n, k) explicitly and just write them as ratios of the previous terms. Example: C(n - 1, k - 1) / C(n, k) = k / n and so on.Complexity: O(n * lgn)Problem F: The Chocolate SpreeThe problem boils down to computing the maximum sum of two disjoint weighted paths in a tree (weight is on the nodes not edges). It can be solved applying DP as in the given solution : http://pastebin.com/L8NNLF3f (Thanks to GlebsHP for the solution!)Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the tree.Problem G: Yash and TreesPerform an euler tour (basically a post/pre order traversal) of the tree and store it as an array. Now, the nodes of the subtree are stored are part of the array as a subarray (contiguous subsequence). Query Type 2 requires you to essentially answer the number of nodes in the subtree such that their value modulo m is a prime. Since, m ≤ 1000, we can build a segment tree(with lazy propagation) where each node has a bitset, say b where b[i] is on iff a value x exists in the segment represented by that node, such that . The addition operations then are simply reduced to bit-rotation within the bitset of the node.Complexity: O(n * lgn * f), where n is the cardinality of the vertices of the tree, f is a small factor denoting the time required for conducting bit rotations on a bitset of size 1000. Problem H: Fibonacci-ish IIThe problem can be solved by taking the queries offline and using a square-root decomposition trick popularly called as “Mo’s algorithm”. Apart from that, segment tree(with lazy propagation) has to be maintained for the Fibonacci-ish potential of the elements in the current [l,r] range. The fact used in the segment tree for lazy propagation is:F(k + 1) * (a1 * F(i) + a2 * F(i + 1)...) + F(k) * (a1 * F(i - 1) + a2 * F(i) + ....) = (a1 * F(i + k) + a2 * F(i + k + 1)....)Example: Suppose currently the array is [100,400,500,100,300]. Using Mo's algorithm, currently the segment tree is configured for the answer of the segment [3,5]. The segment tree' node [4,5] will store answer=500*F(2)=1000. In general, the node [l1, r1] of segment tree will contain answer for the values in the current range of [l2, r2] of Mo's for the values that have rank in sorted array [l1, r1]. The answer will thus be of the form a1 * F(i) + a2 * F(i + 1).... We maintain an invariant that apart from the answer, it will also store answer for one step back in Fibonacci, i.e., a1 * F(i - 1) + a2 * F(i).... Now, when values are added (or removed) in the segment tree, the segments after the point after which the value is added have to be updated. For this we maintain a lazy count parameter (say k). Thus, when we remove the laziness of the node, we use the above stated formula to remove the laziness in O(1) time. Refer our implementation for details: http://pastebin.com/MbQYtReXComplexity:",

          "content": "Problem A: Ebony IvoryThe problem is to find if there exists a solution to the equation: ax + by = c where x and y are both positive integers. The limits are small enough to try all values of x and correspondingly try if such a y exists. The question can also be solved more efficiently using the fact that an integral solution to this problem exists iff gcd(a, b)|c. We just have to make one more check to ensure a positive integral solution.Complexity: O(log(min(a, b))Problem B: A Trivial ProblemWe know how to calculate number of zeros in the factorial of a number. For finding the range of numbers having number of zeros equal to a constant, we can use binary search. Though, the limits are small enough to try and find the number of zeros in factorial of all numbers of the given range.Complexity: O(log(n)2)Problem C: Spy Syndrome 2The given encrypted string can be reversed initially. Then dp[i] can be defined as the index at which the next word should start such that the given string can be formed using the given dictionary. Rabin Karp hashing can be used to compute dp[i] efficiently.Also, care must be taken that in the answer the words have to be printed in the correct casing as they appear in the dictionary.Complexity: O(n * w) where n is the length of the encrypted string, w is the maximum length of any word in the dictionary.Problem D: Fibonacci-ishThe key to the solution is that the complete Fibonacci-ish sequence is determined by the first two terms. Another thing to note is that for the given constraints on a[i], the length of the Fibonacci-ish sequence is of logarithmic order (the longest sequence possible under current constraints was of length~90) except for the case where a[i] = a[j] = 0, where the length can become as long as the length of the given sequence. Thus, the case for 0 has to be handled separately.Complexity: O(n * n * l) where n is the length of the given sequence and l is the length of the longest Fibonacci-ish subsequence.Problem E: Startup fundingLet us denote the number of visitors in the ith week by v[i] and the revenue in the ith week by r[i].Let us define z[i] = max(min( 100 * max(v[i...j]), min(c[i...j]))) for all (j >  = i). Note that max(v[i...j]) is an increasing function in j and min(r[i...j]) is a decreasing function in j. Thus, for all i, z[i] can be computed using RMQ sparse table in combination with binary search.Thus the question reduces to selecting k values randomly from the array z. Let us suppose we select these k values and call the minimum of these values x. Now, x is the random variable whose expected value we need to find. If we sort z in non-decreasing order:E(X) = (z[1] * C(n - 1, k - 1) + z[2] * C(n - 2, k - 1) + z[3] * C(n - 3, k - 1)....) / (C(n, k))where C(n, k) is the number of ways of selecting k objects out of n. Since C(n, k) will be big values, we should not compute C(n, k) explicitly and just write them as ratios of the previous terms. Example: C(n - 1, k - 1) / C(n, k) = k / n and so on.Complexity: O(n * lgn)Problem F: The Chocolate SpreeThe problem boils down to computing the maximum sum of two disjoint weighted paths in a tree (weight is on the nodes not edges). It can be solved applying DP as in the given solution : http://pastebin.com/L8NNLF3f (Thanks to GlebsHP for the solution!)Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the tree.Problem G: Yash and TreesPerform an euler tour (basically a post/pre order traversal) of the tree and store it as an array. Now, the nodes of the subtree are stored are part of the array as a subarray (contiguous subsequence). Query Type 2 requires you to essentially answer the number of nodes in the subtree such that their value modulo m is a prime. Since, m ≤ 1000, we can build a segment tree(with lazy propagation) where each node has a bitset, say b where b[i] is on iff a value x exists in the segment represented by that node, such that . The addition operations then are simply reduced to bit-rotation within the bitset of the node.Complexity: O(n * lgn * f), where n is the cardinality of the vertices of the tree, f is a small factor denoting the time required for conducting bit rotations on a bitset of size 1000. Problem H: Fibonacci-ish IIThe problem can be solved by taking the queries offline and using a square-root decomposition trick popularly called as “Mo’s algorithm”. Apart from that, segment tree(with lazy propagation) has to be maintained for the Fibonacci-ish potential of the elements in the current [l,r] range. The fact used in the segment tree for lazy propagation is:F(k + 1) * (a1 * F(i) + a2 * F(i + 1)...) + F(k) * (a1 * F(i - 1) + a2 * F(i) + ....) = (a1 * F(i + k) + a2 * F(i + k + 1)....)Example: Suppose currently the array is [100,400,500,100,300]. Using Mo's algorithm, currently the segment tree is configured for the answer of the segment [3,5]. The segment tree' node [4,5] will store answer=500*F(2)=1000. In general, the node [l1, r1] of segment tree will contain answer for the values in the current range of [l2, r2] of Mo's for the values that have rank in sorted array [l1, r1]. The answer will thus be of the form a1 * F(i) + a2 * F(i + 1).... We maintain an invariant that apart from the answer, it will also store answer for one step back in Fibonacci, i.e., a1 * F(i - 1) + a2 * F(i).... Now, when values are added (or removed) in the segment tree, the segments after the point after which the value is added have to be updated. For this we maintain a lazy count parameter (say k). Thus, when we remove the laziness of the node, we use the above stated formula to remove the laziness in O(1) time. Refer our implementation for details: http://pastebin.com/MbQYtReXComplexity:",

          "content": "Problem A: Ebony IvoryThe problem is to find if there exists a solution to the equation: ax + by = c where x and y are both positive integers. The limits are small enough to try all values of x and correspondingly try if such a y exists. The question can also be solved more efficiently using the fact that an integral solution to this problem exists iff gcd(a, b)|c. We just have to make one more check to ensure a positive integral solution.Complexity: O(log(min(a, b))Problem B: A Trivial ProblemWe know how to calculate number of zeros in the factorial of a number. For finding the range of numbers having number of zeros equal to a constant, we can use binary search. Though, the limits are small enough to try and find the number of zeros in factorial of all numbers of the given range.Complexity: O(log(n)2)Problem C: Spy Syndrome 2The given encrypted string can be reversed initially. Then dp[i] can be defined as the index at which the next word should start such that the given string can be formed using the given dictionary. Rabin Karp hashing can be used to compute dp[i] efficiently.Also, care must be taken that in the answer the words have to be printed in the correct casing as they appear in the dictionary.Complexity: O(n * w) where n is the length of the encrypted string, w is the maximum length of any word in the dictionary.Problem D: Fibonacci-ishThe key to the solution is that the complete Fibonacci-ish sequence is determined by the first two terms. Another thing to note is that for the given constraints on a[i], the length of the Fibonacci-ish sequence is of logarithmic order (the longest sequence possible under current constraints was of length~90) except for the case where a[i] = a[j] = 0, where the length can become as long as the length of the given sequence. Thus, the case for 0 has to be handled separately.Complexity: O(n * n * l) where n is the length of the given sequence and l is the length of the longest Fibonacci-ish subsequence.Problem E: Startup fundingLet us denote the number of visitors in the ith week by v[i] and the revenue in the ith week by r[i].Let us define z[i] = max(min( 100 * max(v[i...j]), min(c[i...j]))) for all (j >  = i). Note that max(v[i...j]) is an increasing function in j and min(r[i...j]) is a decreasing function in j. Thus, for all i, z[i] can be computed using RMQ sparse table in combination with binary search.Thus the question reduces to selecting k values randomly from the array z. Let us suppose we select these k values and call the minimum of these values x. Now, x is the random variable whose expected value we need to find. If we sort z in non-decreasing order:E(X) = (z[1] * C(n - 1, k - 1) + z[2] * C(n - 2, k - 1) + z[3] * C(n - 3, k - 1)....) / (C(n, k))where C(n, k) is the number of ways of selecting k objects out of n. Since C(n, k) will be big values, we should not compute C(n, k) explicitly and just write them as ratios of the previous terms. Example: C(n - 1, k - 1) / C(n, k) = k / n and so on.Complexity: O(n * lgn)Problem F: The Chocolate SpreeThe problem boils down to computing the maximum sum of two disjoint weighted paths in a tree (weight is on the nodes not edges). It can be solved applying DP as in the given solution : http://pastebin.com/L8NNLF3f (Thanks to GlebsHP for the solution!)Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the tree.Problem G: Yash and TreesPerform an euler tour (basically a post/pre order traversal) of the tree and store it as an array. Now, the nodes of the subtree are stored are part of the array as a subarray (contiguous subsequence). Query Type 2 requires you to essentially answer the number of nodes in the subtree such that their value modulo m is a prime. Since, m ≤ 1000, we can build a segment tree(with lazy propagation) where each node has a bitset, say b where b[i] is on iff a value x exists in the segment represented by that node, such that . The addition operations then are simply reduced to bit-rotation within the bitset of the node.Complexity: O(n * lgn * f), where n is the cardinality of the vertices of the tree, f is a small factor denoting the time required for conducting bit rotations on a bitset of size 1000. Problem H: Fibonacci-ish IIThe problem can be solved by taking the queries offline and using a square-root decomposition trick popularly called as “Mo’s algorithm”. Apart from that, segment tree(with lazy propagation) has to be maintained for the Fibonacci-ish potential of the elements in the current [l,r] range. The fact used in the segment tree for lazy propagation is:F(k + 1) * (a1 * F(i) + a2 * F(i + 1)...) + F(k) * (a1 * F(i - 1) + a2 * F(i) + ....) = (a1 * F(i + k) + a2 * F(i + k + 1)....)Example: Suppose currently the array is [100,400,500,100,300]. Using Mo's algorithm, currently the segment tree is configured for the answer of the segment [3,5]. The segment tree' node [4,5] will store answer=500*F(2)=1000. In general, the node [l1, r1] of segment tree will contain answer for the values in the current range of [l2, r2] of Mo's for the values that have rank in sorted array [l1, r1]. The answer will thus be of the form a1 * F(i) + a2 * F(i + 1).... We maintain an invariant that apart from the answer, it will also store answer for one step back in Fibonacci, i.e., a1 * F(i - 1) + a2 * F(i).... Now, when values are added (or removed) in the segment tree, the segments after the point after which the value is added have to be updated. For this we maintain a lazy count parameter (say k). Thus, when we remove the laziness of the node, we use the above stated formula to remove the laziness in O(1) time. Refer our implementation for details: http://pastebin.com/MbQYtReXComplexity:",

          "content": "635A - OrchestraWe can iterate over each possible rectangle and count the number of violists enclosed. This can be optimized with rectangular prefix sums, though the simple brute force is sufficient for this problem.Runtime: O(n6)634A - Island PuzzleNotice that, as we move the empty pedestal around the circle, we cyclically permute the statues (and the empty pedestal can be anywhere). Thus, we can reach one state from another if and only if, after removing the empty pedestal, they are cyclic shifts of each other. The starting and ending configurations are permutations, so we can check this in linear time.Runtime: O(n)627A - XOR EquationFor any two integers a and b, we have , where is the xor and a&b is the bitwise AND. This is because is non-carrying binary addition. Thus, we can find a&b = (s - x) / 2 (if this is not an integer, there are no solutions).Now, for each bit, we have 4 cases: , and . If , then ai = bi, so we have one possibility: ai = bi = ai&bi. If , then we must have ai&bi = 0 (otherwise we print 0), and we have two choices: ai = 1 and bi = 0 or vice versa. Thus, we can return 2n, where n is the number of one-bits in x. (Remember to subtract 2 for the cases a = 0 or b = 0 if necessary.)Runtime: 627B - Factory RepairsUsing two binary-indexed trees, we can maintain the prefix and suffix sums of the amounts we can produce with maximum production rates of B and A, respectively. Then we can just query the binary-indexed trees to find the maximum possible production given the start and end of the repairs.Runtime: .627C - Package DeliveryWe solve this with a greedy algorithm: for each gas station, we fill our tank to min(n, d) liters of gasoline, where d is the distance to the next gas station with cheaper (or equal) gas. This is optimal, as, if we can make it to a station with cheaper gas without buying expensive gas, we should (and fill up our tank at the cheaper station). Otherwise, all stations within range n are more expensive, so we should buy as much gas as possible right now.Alternatively, if we say that we always “use” the gasoline we buy in the order we buy it, then the gasoline used in the ith unit must have been purchased within the last n units. Then we can greedily use the cheapest gas within the last n miles. We can maintain this in a queue with range-min-query, which gives us linear runtime (after sorting).Runtime: 627D - Preorder TestWe binary search on the answer, so we need to answer queries of the following form: is the a depth-first search traversal such that the first k vertices all have value at least v? We can answer this with a greedy tree-DP: for each subtree, we compute whether or not all its vertices have value at least v, and if not, the longest possible prefix with all values at least v. Then, our transition function can be greedy: the maximum possible prefix with all values at least v is the sum of the sizes of all child subtrees which are all at least v plus the largest prefix of all child subtrees.Runtime: 627E - OrchestraWe can think of a rectangle in the grid as a pair of an (xlo, xhi) interval and a (ylo, yhi) interval. Suppose we fix the x-interval and want to determine the number of corresponding y intervals which create rectangles containing at least k violists. Given a sorted list of the y-coordinates of all violists in the range, this is simple: m violists split the y-coordinates into m + 1 (possibly empty) intervals that span all the columns, and the number of total intervals that work is simply the number of pairs of points that are at least k intervals apart.As we sweep over the xhi coordinate and maintain the list of violists, we want to insert each violist into a sorted list and look at its k nearest neighbors to determine the change in number of intervals. Inserting violists into a sorted list, however, is difficult to do in constant time. Instead, we sweep in reverse. Start with xhi = r and a linked list containing all the desired violists; decrementing xhi is now a simple process of removing the necessary elements from a linked list and examining their neighbors as we do so.Runtime: O(r2k + rnk)627F - Island PuzzleFirst, if we never move the empty pedestal through any cycle, then moving the empty pedestal to and from any given position cannot change the location of the statues, as performing a move in the opposite direction as the previous undoes the previous move.Thus, in our graph with one cycle, we can only do the following two operations: move the empty pedestal from one location to another (without loss of generality, only using the original tree), and cyclically permute the elements along the one cycle (except the element closest to the root).Now, to check satisfiability, we can greedily first move the empty pedestal from its start position to its end position -- since this procedure can be undone, it will never change the satisfiability of the rearrangement. Then, we only have to check that all changed elements lie on a possible cycle. This uniquely determines the edge to be added.To compute the minimum number of moves, we compute the minimum moves to move the empty pedestal from the start to the cycle, the minimum moves to permute the cycle as desired, and the minimum moves from the cycle to the end point.Runtime: O(n)",

          "content": "635A - OrchestraWe can iterate over each possible rectangle and count the number of violists enclosed. This can be optimized with rectangular prefix sums, though the simple brute force is sufficient for this problem.Runtime: O(n6)634A - Island PuzzleNotice that, as we move the empty pedestal around the circle, we cyclically permute the statues (and the empty pedestal can be anywhere). Thus, we can reach one state from another if and only if, after removing the empty pedestal, they are cyclic shifts of each other. The starting and ending configurations are permutations, so we can check this in linear time.Runtime: O(n)627A - XOR EquationFor any two integers a and b, we have , where is the xor and a&b is the bitwise AND. This is because is non-carrying binary addition. Thus, we can find a&b = (s - x) / 2 (if this is not an integer, there are no solutions).Now, for each bit, we have 4 cases: , and . If , then ai = bi, so we have one possibility: ai = bi = ai&bi. If , then we must have ai&bi = 0 (otherwise we print 0), and we have two choices: ai = 1 and bi = 0 or vice versa. Thus, we can return 2n, where n is the number of one-bits in x. (Remember to subtract 2 for the cases a = 0 or b = 0 if necessary.)Runtime: 627B - Factory RepairsUsing two binary-indexed trees, we can maintain the prefix and suffix sums of the amounts we can produce with maximum production rates of B and A, respectively. Then we can just query the binary-indexed trees to find the maximum possible production given the start and end of the repairs.Runtime: .627C - Package DeliveryWe solve this with a greedy algorithm: for each gas station, we fill our tank to min(n, d) liters of gasoline, where d is the distance to the next gas station with cheaper (or equal) gas. This is optimal, as, if we can make it to a station with cheaper gas without buying expensive gas, we should (and fill up our tank at the cheaper station). Otherwise, all stations within range n are more expensive, so we should buy as much gas as possible right now.Alternatively, if we say that we always “use” the gasoline we buy in the order we buy it, then the gasoline used in the ith unit must have been purchased within the last n units. Then we can greedily use the cheapest gas within the last n miles. We can maintain this in a queue with range-min-query, which gives us linear runtime (after sorting).Runtime: 627D - Preorder TestWe binary search on the answer, so we need to answer queries of the following form: is the a depth-first search traversal such that the first k vertices all have value at least v? We can answer this with a greedy tree-DP: for each subtree, we compute whether or not all its vertices have value at least v, and if not, the longest possible prefix with all values at least v. Then, our transition function can be greedy: the maximum possible prefix with all values at least v is the sum of the sizes of all child subtrees which are all at least v plus the largest prefix of all child subtrees.Runtime: 627E - OrchestraWe can think of a rectangle in the grid as a pair of an (xlo, xhi) interval and a (ylo, yhi) interval. Suppose we fix the x-interval and want to determine the number of corresponding y intervals which create rectangles containing at least k violists. Given a sorted list of the y-coordinates of all violists in the range, this is simple: m violists split the y-coordinates into m + 1 (possibly empty) intervals that span all the columns, and the number of total intervals that work is simply the number of pairs of points that are at least k intervals apart.As we sweep over the xhi coordinate and maintain the list of violists, we want to insert each violist into a sorted list and look at its k nearest neighbors to determine the change in number of intervals. Inserting violists into a sorted list, however, is difficult to do in constant time. Instead, we sweep in reverse. Start with xhi = r and a linked list containing all the desired violists; decrementing xhi is now a simple process of removing the necessary elements from a linked list and examining their neighbors as we do so.Runtime: O(r2k + rnk)627F - Island PuzzleFirst, if we never move the empty pedestal through any cycle, then moving the empty pedestal to and from any given position cannot change the location of the statues, as performing a move in the opposite direction as the previous undoes the previous move.Thus, in our graph with one cycle, we can only do the following two operations: move the empty pedestal from one location to another (without loss of generality, only using the original tree), and cyclically permute the elements along the one cycle (except the element closest to the root).Now, to check satisfiability, we can greedily first move the empty pedestal from its start position to its end position -- since this procedure can be undone, it will never change the satisfiability of the rearrangement. Then, we only have to check that all changed elements lie on a possible cycle. This uniquely determines the edge to be added.To compute the minimum number of moves, we compute the minimum moves to move the empty pedestal from the start to the cycle, the minimum moves to permute the cycle as desired, and the minimum moves from the cycle to the end point.Runtime: O(n)",

          "content": "635A - OrchestraWe can iterate over each possible rectangle and count the number of violists enclosed. This can be optimized with rectangular prefix sums, though the simple brute force is sufficient for this problem.Runtime: O(n6)634A - Island PuzzleNotice that, as we move the empty pedestal around the circle, we cyclically permute the statues (and the empty pedestal can be anywhere). Thus, we can reach one state from another if and only if, after removing the empty pedestal, they are cyclic shifts of each other. The starting and ending configurations are permutations, so we can check this in linear time.Runtime: O(n)627A - XOR EquationFor any two integers a and b, we have , where is the xor and a&b is the bitwise AND. This is because is non-carrying binary addition. Thus, we can find a&b = (s - x) / 2 (if this is not an integer, there are no solutions).Now, for each bit, we have 4 cases: , and . If , then ai = bi, so we have one possibility: ai = bi = ai&bi. If , then we must have ai&bi = 0 (otherwise we print 0), and we have two choices: ai = 1 and bi = 0 or vice versa. Thus, we can return 2n, where n is the number of one-bits in x. (Remember to subtract 2 for the cases a = 0 or b = 0 if necessary.)Runtime: 627B - Factory RepairsUsing two binary-indexed trees, we can maintain the prefix and suffix sums of the amounts we can produce with maximum production rates of B and A, respectively. Then we can just query the binary-indexed trees to find the maximum possible production given the start and end of the repairs.Runtime: .627C - Package DeliveryWe solve this with a greedy algorithm: for each gas station, we fill our tank to min(n, d) liters of gasoline, where d is the distance to the next gas station with cheaper (or equal) gas. This is optimal, as, if we can make it to a station with cheaper gas without buying expensive gas, we should (and fill up our tank at the cheaper station). Otherwise, all stations within range n are more expensive, so we should buy as much gas as possible right now.Alternatively, if we say that we always “use” the gasoline we buy in the order we buy it, then the gasoline used in the ith unit must have been purchased within the last n units. Then we can greedily use the cheapest gas within the last n miles. We can maintain this in a queue with range-min-query, which gives us linear runtime (after sorting).Runtime: 627D - Preorder TestWe binary search on the answer, so we need to answer queries of the following form: is the a depth-first search traversal such that the first k vertices all have value at least v? We can answer this with a greedy tree-DP: for each subtree, we compute whether or not all its vertices have value at least v, and if not, the longest possible prefix with all values at least v. Then, our transition function can be greedy: the maximum possible prefix with all values at least v is the sum of the sizes of all child subtrees which are all at least v plus the largest prefix of all child subtrees.Runtime: 627E - OrchestraWe can think of a rectangle in the grid as a pair of an (xlo, xhi) interval and a (ylo, yhi) interval. Suppose we fix the x-interval and want to determine the number of corresponding y intervals which create rectangles containing at least k violists. Given a sorted list of the y-coordinates of all violists in the range, this is simple: m violists split the y-coordinates into m + 1 (possibly empty) intervals that span all the columns, and the number of total intervals that work is simply the number of pairs of points that are at least k intervals apart.As we sweep over the xhi coordinate and maintain the list of violists, we want to insert each violist into a sorted list and look at its k nearest neighbors to determine the change in number of intervals. Inserting violists into a sorted list, however, is difficult to do in constant time. Instead, we sweep in reverse. Start with xhi = r and a linked list containing all the desired violists; decrementing xhi is now a simple process of removing the necessary elements from a linked list and examining their neighbors as we do so.Runtime: O(r2k + rnk)627F - Island PuzzleFirst, if we never move the empty pedestal through any cycle, then moving the empty pedestal to and from any given position cannot change the location of the statues, as performing a move in the opposite direction as the previous undoes the previous move.Thus, in our graph with one cycle, we can only do the following two operations: move the empty pedestal from one location to another (without loss of generality, only using the original tree), and cyclically permute the elements along the one cycle (except the element closest to the root).Now, to check satisfiability, we can greedily first move the empty pedestal from its start position to its end position -- since this procedure can be undone, it will never change the satisfiability of the rearrangement. Then, we only have to check that all changed elements lie on a possible cycle. This uniquely determines the edge to be added.To compute the minimum number of moves, we compute the minimum moves to move the empty pedestal from the start to the cycle, the minimum moves to permute the cycle as desired, and the minimum moves from the cycle to the end point.Runtime: O(n)",

          "content": "635A - OrchestraWe can iterate over each possible rectangle and count the number of violists enclosed. This can be optimized with rectangular prefix sums, though the simple brute force is sufficient for this problem.Runtime: O(n6)634A - Island PuzzleNotice that, as we move the empty pedestal around the circle, we cyclically permute the statues (and the empty pedestal can be anywhere). Thus, we can reach one state from another if and only if, after removing the empty pedestal, they are cyclic shifts of each other. The starting and ending configurations are permutations, so we can check this in linear time.Runtime: O(n)627A - XOR EquationFor any two integers a and b, we have , where is the xor and a&b is the bitwise AND. This is because is non-carrying binary addition. Thus, we can find a&b = (s - x) / 2 (if this is not an integer, there are no solutions).Now, for each bit, we have 4 cases: , and . If , then ai = bi, so we have one possibility: ai = bi = ai&bi. If , then we must have ai&bi = 0 (otherwise we print 0), and we have two choices: ai = 1 and bi = 0 or vice versa. Thus, we can return 2n, where n is the number of one-bits in x. (Remember to subtract 2 for the cases a = 0 or b = 0 if necessary.)Runtime: 627B - Factory RepairsUsing two binary-indexed trees, we can maintain the prefix and suffix sums of the amounts we can produce with maximum production rates of B and A, respectively. Then we can just query the binary-indexed trees to find the maximum possible production given the start and end of the repairs.Runtime: .627C - Package DeliveryWe solve this with a greedy algorithm: for each gas station, we fill our tank to min(n, d) liters of gasoline, where d is the distance to the next gas station with cheaper (or equal) gas. This is optimal, as, if we can make it to a station with cheaper gas without buying expensive gas, we should (and fill up our tank at the cheaper station). Otherwise, all stations within range n are more expensive, so we should buy as much gas as possible right now.Alternatively, if we say that we always “use” the gasoline we buy in the order we buy it, then the gasoline used in the ith unit must have been purchased within the last n units. Then we can greedily use the cheapest gas within the last n miles. We can maintain this in a queue with range-min-query, which gives us linear runtime (after sorting).Runtime: 627D - Preorder TestWe binary search on the answer, so we need to answer queries of the following form: is the a depth-first search traversal such that the first k vertices all have value at least v? We can answer this with a greedy tree-DP: for each subtree, we compute whether or not all its vertices have value at least v, and if not, the longest possible prefix with all values at least v. Then, our transition function can be greedy: the maximum possible prefix with all values at least v is the sum of the sizes of all child subtrees which are all at least v plus the largest prefix of all child subtrees.Runtime: 627E - OrchestraWe can think of a rectangle in the grid as a pair of an (xlo, xhi) interval and a (ylo, yhi) interval. Suppose we fix the x-interval and want to determine the number of corresponding y intervals which create rectangles containing at least k violists. Given a sorted list of the y-coordinates of all violists in the range, this is simple: m violists split the y-coordinates into m + 1 (possibly empty) intervals that span all the columns, and the number of total intervals that work is simply the number of pairs of points that are at least k intervals apart.As we sweep over the xhi coordinate and maintain the list of violists, we want to insert each violist into a sorted list and look at its k nearest neighbors to determine the change in number of intervals. Inserting violists into a sorted list, however, is difficult to do in constant time. Instead, we sweep in reverse. Start with xhi = r and a linked list containing all the desired violists; decrementing xhi is now a simple process of removing the necessary elements from a linked list and examining their neighbors as we do so.Runtime: O(r2k + rnk)627F - Island PuzzleFirst, if we never move the empty pedestal through any cycle, then moving the empty pedestal to and from any given position cannot change the location of the statues, as performing a move in the opposite direction as the previous undoes the previous move.Thus, in our graph with one cycle, we can only do the following two operations: move the empty pedestal from one location to another (without loss of generality, only using the original tree), and cyclically permute the elements along the one cycle (except the element closest to the root).Now, to check satisfiability, we can greedily first move the empty pedestal from its start position to its end position -- since this procedure can be undone, it will never change the satisfiability of the rearrangement. Then, we only have to check that all changed elements lie on a possible cycle. This uniquely determines the edge to be added.To compute the minimum number of moves, we compute the minimum moves to move the empty pedestal from the start to the cycle, the minimum moves to permute the cycle as desired, and the minimum moves from the cycle to the end point.Runtime: O(n)",

          "content": "635A - OrchestraWe can iterate over each possible rectangle and count the number of violists enclosed. This can be optimized with rectangular prefix sums, though the simple brute force is sufficient for this problem.Runtime: O(n6)634A - Island PuzzleNotice that, as we move the empty pedestal around the circle, we cyclically permute the statues (and the empty pedestal can be anywhere). Thus, we can reach one state from another if and only if, after removing the empty pedestal, they are cyclic shifts of each other. The starting and ending configurations are permutations, so we can check this in linear time.Runtime: O(n)627A - XOR EquationFor any two integers a and b, we have , where is the xor and a&b is the bitwise AND. This is because is non-carrying binary addition. Thus, we can find a&b = (s - x) / 2 (if this is not an integer, there are no solutions).Now, for each bit, we have 4 cases: , and . If , then ai = bi, so we have one possibility: ai = bi = ai&bi. If , then we must have ai&bi = 0 (otherwise we print 0), and we have two choices: ai = 1 and bi = 0 or vice versa. Thus, we can return 2n, where n is the number of one-bits in x. (Remember to subtract 2 for the cases a = 0 or b = 0 if necessary.)Runtime: 627B - Factory RepairsUsing two binary-indexed trees, we can maintain the prefix and suffix sums of the amounts we can produce with maximum production rates of B and A, respectively. Then we can just query the binary-indexed trees to find the maximum possible production given the start and end of the repairs.Runtime: .627C - Package DeliveryWe solve this with a greedy algorithm: for each gas station, we fill our tank to min(n, d) liters of gasoline, where d is the distance to the next gas station with cheaper (or equal) gas. This is optimal, as, if we can make it to a station with cheaper gas without buying expensive gas, we should (and fill up our tank at the cheaper station). Otherwise, all stations within range n are more expensive, so we should buy as much gas as possible right now.Alternatively, if we say that we always “use” the gasoline we buy in the order we buy it, then the gasoline used in the ith unit must have been purchased within the last n units. Then we can greedily use the cheapest gas within the last n miles. We can maintain this in a queue with range-min-query, which gives us linear runtime (after sorting).Runtime: 627D - Preorder TestWe binary search on the answer, so we need to answer queries of the following form: is the a depth-first search traversal such that the first k vertices all have value at least v? We can answer this with a greedy tree-DP: for each subtree, we compute whether or not all its vertices have value at least v, and if not, the longest possible prefix with all values at least v. Then, our transition function can be greedy: the maximum possible prefix with all values at least v is the sum of the sizes of all child subtrees which are all at least v plus the largest prefix of all child subtrees.Runtime: 627E - OrchestraWe can think of a rectangle in the grid as a pair of an (xlo, xhi) interval and a (ylo, yhi) interval. Suppose we fix the x-interval and want to determine the number of corresponding y intervals which create rectangles containing at least k violists. Given a sorted list of the y-coordinates of all violists in the range, this is simple: m violists split the y-coordinates into m + 1 (possibly empty) intervals that span all the columns, and the number of total intervals that work is simply the number of pairs of points that are at least k intervals apart.As we sweep over the xhi coordinate and maintain the list of violists, we want to insert each violist into a sorted list and look at its k nearest neighbors to determine the change in number of intervals. Inserting violists into a sorted list, however, is difficult to do in constant time. Instead, we sweep in reverse. Start with xhi = r and a linked list containing all the desired violists; decrementing xhi is now a simple process of removing the necessary elements from a linked list and examining their neighbors as we do so.Runtime: O(r2k + rnk)627F - Island PuzzleFirst, if we never move the empty pedestal through any cycle, then moving the empty pedestal to and from any given position cannot change the location of the statues, as performing a move in the opposite direction as the previous undoes the previous move.Thus, in our graph with one cycle, we can only do the following two operations: move the empty pedestal from one location to another (without loss of generality, only using the original tree), and cyclically permute the elements along the one cycle (except the element closest to the root).Now, to check satisfiability, we can greedily first move the empty pedestal from its start position to its end position -- since this procedure can be undone, it will never change the satisfiability of the rearrangement. Then, we only have to check that all changed elements lie on a possible cycle. This uniquely determines the edge to be added.To compute the minimum number of moves, we compute the minimum moves to move the empty pedestal from the start to the cycle, the minimum moves to permute the cycle as desired, and the minimum moves from the cycle to the end point.Runtime: O(n)",

          "content": "635A - OrchestraWe can iterate over each possible rectangle and count the number of violists enclosed. This can be optimized with rectangular prefix sums, though the simple brute force is sufficient for this problem.Runtime: O(n6)634A - Island PuzzleNotice that, as we move the empty pedestal around the circle, we cyclically permute the statues (and the empty pedestal can be anywhere). Thus, we can reach one state from another if and only if, after removing the empty pedestal, they are cyclic shifts of each other. The starting and ending configurations are permutations, so we can check this in linear time.Runtime: O(n)627A - XOR EquationFor any two integers a and b, we have , where is the xor and a&b is the bitwise AND. This is because is non-carrying binary addition. Thus, we can find a&b = (s - x) / 2 (if this is not an integer, there are no solutions).Now, for each bit, we have 4 cases: , and . If , then ai = bi, so we have one possibility: ai = bi = ai&bi. If , then we must have ai&bi = 0 (otherwise we print 0), and we have two choices: ai = 1 and bi = 0 or vice versa. Thus, we can return 2n, where n is the number of one-bits in x. (Remember to subtract 2 for the cases a = 0 or b = 0 if necessary.)Runtime: 627B - Factory RepairsUsing two binary-indexed trees, we can maintain the prefix and suffix sums of the amounts we can produce with maximum production rates of B and A, respectively. Then we can just query the binary-indexed trees to find the maximum possible production given the start and end of the repairs.Runtime: .627C - Package DeliveryWe solve this with a greedy algorithm: for each gas station, we fill our tank to min(n, d) liters of gasoline, where d is the distance to the next gas station with cheaper (or equal) gas. This is optimal, as, if we can make it to a station with cheaper gas without buying expensive gas, we should (and fill up our tank at the cheaper station). Otherwise, all stations within range n are more expensive, so we should buy as much gas as possible right now.Alternatively, if we say that we always “use” the gasoline we buy in the order we buy it, then the gasoline used in the ith unit must have been purchased within the last n units. Then we can greedily use the cheapest gas within the last n miles. We can maintain this in a queue with range-min-query, which gives us linear runtime (after sorting).Runtime: 627D - Preorder TestWe binary search on the answer, so we need to answer queries of the following form: is the a depth-first search traversal such that the first k vertices all have value at least v? We can answer this with a greedy tree-DP: for each subtree, we compute whether or not all its vertices have value at least v, and if not, the longest possible prefix with all values at least v. Then, our transition function can be greedy: the maximum possible prefix with all values at least v is the sum of the sizes of all child subtrees which are all at least v plus the largest prefix of all child subtrees.Runtime: 627E - OrchestraWe can think of a rectangle in the grid as a pair of an (xlo, xhi) interval and a (ylo, yhi) interval. Suppose we fix the x-interval and want to determine the number of corresponding y intervals which create rectangles containing at least k violists. Given a sorted list of the y-coordinates of all violists in the range, this is simple: m violists split the y-coordinates into m + 1 (possibly empty) intervals that span all the columns, and the number of total intervals that work is simply the number of pairs of points that are at least k intervals apart.As we sweep over the xhi coordinate and maintain the list of violists, we want to insert each violist into a sorted list and look at its k nearest neighbors to determine the change in number of intervals. Inserting violists into a sorted list, however, is difficult to do in constant time. Instead, we sweep in reverse. Start with xhi = r and a linked list containing all the desired violists; decrementing xhi is now a simple process of removing the necessary elements from a linked list and examining their neighbors as we do so.Runtime: O(r2k + rnk)627F - Island PuzzleFirst, if we never move the empty pedestal through any cycle, then moving the empty pedestal to and from any given position cannot change the location of the statues, as performing a move in the opposite direction as the previous undoes the previous move.Thus, in our graph with one cycle, we can only do the following two operations: move the empty pedestal from one location to another (without loss of generality, only using the original tree), and cyclically permute the elements along the one cycle (except the element closest to the root).Now, to check satisfiability, we can greedily first move the empty pedestal from its start position to its end position -- since this procedure can be undone, it will never change the satisfiability of the rearrangement. Then, we only have to check that all changed elements lie on a possible cycle. This uniquely determines the edge to be added.To compute the minimum number of moves, we compute the minimum moves to move the empty pedestal from the start to the cycle, the minimum moves to permute the cycle as desired, and the minimum moves from the cycle to the end point.Runtime: O(n)",

          "content": "635A - OrchestraWe can iterate over each possible rectangle and count the number of violists enclosed. This can be optimized with rectangular prefix sums, though the simple brute force is sufficient for this problem.Runtime: O(n6)634A - Island PuzzleNotice that, as we move the empty pedestal around the circle, we cyclically permute the statues (and the empty pedestal can be anywhere). Thus, we can reach one state from another if and only if, after removing the empty pedestal, they are cyclic shifts of each other. The starting and ending configurations are permutations, so we can check this in linear time.Runtime: O(n)627A - XOR EquationFor any two integers a and b, we have , where is the xor and a&b is the bitwise AND. This is because is non-carrying binary addition. Thus, we can find a&b = (s - x) / 2 (if this is not an integer, there are no solutions).Now, for each bit, we have 4 cases: , and . If , then ai = bi, so we have one possibility: ai = bi = ai&bi. If , then we must have ai&bi = 0 (otherwise we print 0), and we have two choices: ai = 1 and bi = 0 or vice versa. Thus, we can return 2n, where n is the number of one-bits in x. (Remember to subtract 2 for the cases a = 0 or b = 0 if necessary.)Runtime: 627B - Factory RepairsUsing two binary-indexed trees, we can maintain the prefix and suffix sums of the amounts we can produce with maximum production rates of B and A, respectively. Then we can just query the binary-indexed trees to find the maximum possible production given the start and end of the repairs.Runtime: .627C - Package DeliveryWe solve this with a greedy algorithm: for each gas station, we fill our tank to min(n, d) liters of gasoline, where d is the distance to the next gas station with cheaper (or equal) gas. This is optimal, as, if we can make it to a station with cheaper gas without buying expensive gas, we should (and fill up our tank at the cheaper station). Otherwise, all stations within range n are more expensive, so we should buy as much gas as possible right now.Alternatively, if we say that we always “use” the gasoline we buy in the order we buy it, then the gasoline used in the ith unit must have been purchased within the last n units. Then we can greedily use the cheapest gas within the last n miles. We can maintain this in a queue with range-min-query, which gives us linear runtime (after sorting).Runtime: 627D - Preorder TestWe binary search on the answer, so we need to answer queries of the following form: is the a depth-first search traversal such that the first k vertices all have value at least v? We can answer this with a greedy tree-DP: for each subtree, we compute whether or not all its vertices have value at least v, and if not, the longest possible prefix with all values at least v. Then, our transition function can be greedy: the maximum possible prefix with all values at least v is the sum of the sizes of all child subtrees which are all at least v plus the largest prefix of all child subtrees.Runtime: 627E - OrchestraWe can think of a rectangle in the grid as a pair of an (xlo, xhi) interval and a (ylo, yhi) interval. Suppose we fix the x-interval and want to determine the number of corresponding y intervals which create rectangles containing at least k violists. Given a sorted list of the y-coordinates of all violists in the range, this is simple: m violists split the y-coordinates into m + 1 (possibly empty) intervals that span all the columns, and the number of total intervals that work is simply the number of pairs of points that are at least k intervals apart.As we sweep over the xhi coordinate and maintain the list of violists, we want to insert each violist into a sorted list and look at its k nearest neighbors to determine the change in number of intervals. Inserting violists into a sorted list, however, is difficult to do in constant time. Instead, we sweep in reverse. Start with xhi = r and a linked list containing all the desired violists; decrementing xhi is now a simple process of removing the necessary elements from a linked list and examining their neighbors as we do so.Runtime: O(r2k + rnk)627F - Island PuzzleFirst, if we never move the empty pedestal through any cycle, then moving the empty pedestal to and from any given position cannot change the location of the statues, as performing a move in the opposite direction as the previous undoes the previous move.Thus, in our graph with one cycle, we can only do the following two operations: move the empty pedestal from one location to another (without loss of generality, only using the original tree), and cyclically permute the elements along the one cycle (except the element closest to the root).Now, to check satisfiability, we can greedily first move the empty pedestal from its start position to its end position -- since this procedure can be undone, it will never change the satisfiability of the rearrangement. Then, we only have to check that all changed elements lie on a possible cycle. This uniquely determines the edge to be added.To compute the minimum number of moves, we compute the minimum moves to move the empty pedestal from the start to the cycle, the minimum moves to permute the cycle as desired, and the minimum moves from the cycle to the end point.Runtime: O(n)",

          "content": "635A - OrchestraWe can iterate over each possible rectangle and count the number of violists enclosed. This can be optimized with rectangular prefix sums, though the simple brute force is sufficient for this problem.Runtime: O(n6)634A - Island PuzzleNotice that, as we move the empty pedestal around the circle, we cyclically permute the statues (and the empty pedestal can be anywhere). Thus, we can reach one state from another if and only if, after removing the empty pedestal, they are cyclic shifts of each other. The starting and ending configurations are permutations, so we can check this in linear time.Runtime: O(n)627A - XOR EquationFor any two integers a and b, we have , where is the xor and a&b is the bitwise AND. This is because is non-carrying binary addition. Thus, we can find a&b = (s - x) / 2 (if this is not an integer, there are no solutions).Now, for each bit, we have 4 cases: , and . If , then ai = bi, so we have one possibility: ai = bi = ai&bi. If , then we must have ai&bi = 0 (otherwise we print 0), and we have two choices: ai = 1 and bi = 0 or vice versa. Thus, we can return 2n, where n is the number of one-bits in x. (Remember to subtract 2 for the cases a = 0 or b = 0 if necessary.)Runtime: 627B - Factory RepairsUsing two binary-indexed trees, we can maintain the prefix and suffix sums of the amounts we can produce with maximum production rates of B and A, respectively. Then we can just query the binary-indexed trees to find the maximum possible production given the start and end of the repairs.Runtime: .627C - Package DeliveryWe solve this with a greedy algorithm: for each gas station, we fill our tank to min(n, d) liters of gasoline, where d is the distance to the next gas station with cheaper (or equal) gas. This is optimal, as, if we can make it to a station with cheaper gas without buying expensive gas, we should (and fill up our tank at the cheaper station). Otherwise, all stations within range n are more expensive, so we should buy as much gas as possible right now.Alternatively, if we say that we always “use” the gasoline we buy in the order we buy it, then the gasoline used in the ith unit must have been purchased within the last n units. Then we can greedily use the cheapest gas within the last n miles. We can maintain this in a queue with range-min-query, which gives us linear runtime (after sorting).Runtime: 627D - Preorder TestWe binary search on the answer, so we need to answer queries of the following form: is the a depth-first search traversal such that the first k vertices all have value at least v? We can answer this with a greedy tree-DP: for each subtree, we compute whether or not all its vertices have value at least v, and if not, the longest possible prefix with all values at least v. Then, our transition function can be greedy: the maximum possible prefix with all values at least v is the sum of the sizes of all child subtrees which are all at least v plus the largest prefix of all child subtrees.Runtime: 627E - OrchestraWe can think of a rectangle in the grid as a pair of an (xlo, xhi) interval and a (ylo, yhi) interval. Suppose we fix the x-interval and want to determine the number of corresponding y intervals which create rectangles containing at least k violists. Given a sorted list of the y-coordinates of all violists in the range, this is simple: m violists split the y-coordinates into m + 1 (possibly empty) intervals that span all the columns, and the number of total intervals that work is simply the number of pairs of points that are at least k intervals apart.As we sweep over the xhi coordinate and maintain the list of violists, we want to insert each violist into a sorted list and look at its k nearest neighbors to determine the change in number of intervals. Inserting violists into a sorted list, however, is difficult to do in constant time. Instead, we sweep in reverse. Start with xhi = r and a linked list containing all the desired violists; decrementing xhi is now a simple process of removing the necessary elements from a linked list and examining their neighbors as we do so.Runtime: O(r2k + rnk)627F - Island PuzzleFirst, if we never move the empty pedestal through any cycle, then moving the empty pedestal to and from any given position cannot change the location of the statues, as performing a move in the opposite direction as the previous undoes the previous move.Thus, in our graph with one cycle, we can only do the following two operations: move the empty pedestal from one location to another (without loss of generality, only using the original tree), and cyclically permute the elements along the one cycle (except the element closest to the root).Now, to check satisfiability, we can greedily first move the empty pedestal from its start position to its end position -- since this procedure can be undone, it will never change the satisfiability of the rearrangement. Then, we only have to check that all changed elements lie on a possible cycle. This uniquely determines the edge to be added.To compute the minimum number of moves, we compute the minimum moves to move the empty pedestal from the start to the cycle, the minimum moves to permute the cycle as desired, and the minimum moves from the cycle to the end point.Runtime: O(n)",

          "content": "635A - OrchestraWe can iterate over each possible rectangle and count the number of violists enclosed. This can be optimized with rectangular prefix sums, though the simple brute force is sufficient for this problem.Runtime: O(n6)634A - Island PuzzleNotice that, as we move the empty pedestal around the circle, we cyclically permute the statues (and the empty pedestal can be anywhere). Thus, we can reach one state from another if and only if, after removing the empty pedestal, they are cyclic shifts of each other. The starting and ending configurations are permutations, so we can check this in linear time.Runtime: O(n)627A - XOR EquationFor any two integers a and b, we have , where is the xor and a&b is the bitwise AND. This is because is non-carrying binary addition. Thus, we can find a&b = (s - x) / 2 (if this is not an integer, there are no solutions).Now, for each bit, we have 4 cases: , and . If , then ai = bi, so we have one possibility: ai = bi = ai&bi. If , then we must have ai&bi = 0 (otherwise we print 0), and we have two choices: ai = 1 and bi = 0 or vice versa. Thus, we can return 2n, where n is the number of one-bits in x. (Remember to subtract 2 for the cases a = 0 or b = 0 if necessary.)Runtime: 627B - Factory RepairsUsing two binary-indexed trees, we can maintain the prefix and suffix sums of the amounts we can produce with maximum production rates of B and A, respectively. Then we can just query the binary-indexed trees to find the maximum possible production given the start and end of the repairs.Runtime: .627C - Package DeliveryWe solve this with a greedy algorithm: for each gas station, we fill our tank to min(n, d) liters of gasoline, where d is the distance to the next gas station with cheaper (or equal) gas. This is optimal, as, if we can make it to a station with cheaper gas without buying expensive gas, we should (and fill up our tank at the cheaper station). Otherwise, all stations within range n are more expensive, so we should buy as much gas as possible right now.Alternatively, if we say that we always “use” the gasoline we buy in the order we buy it, then the gasoline used in the ith unit must have been purchased within the last n units. Then we can greedily use the cheapest gas within the last n miles. We can maintain this in a queue with range-min-query, which gives us linear runtime (after sorting).Runtime: 627D - Preorder TestWe binary search on the answer, so we need to answer queries of the following form: is the a depth-first search traversal such that the first k vertices all have value at least v? We can answer this with a greedy tree-DP: for each subtree, we compute whether or not all its vertices have value at least v, and if not, the longest possible prefix with all values at least v. Then, our transition function can be greedy: the maximum possible prefix with all values at least v is the sum of the sizes of all child subtrees which are all at least v plus the largest prefix of all child subtrees.Runtime: 627E - OrchestraWe can think of a rectangle in the grid as a pair of an (xlo, xhi) interval and a (ylo, yhi) interval. Suppose we fix the x-interval and want to determine the number of corresponding y intervals which create rectangles containing at least k violists. Given a sorted list of the y-coordinates of all violists in the range, this is simple: m violists split the y-coordinates into m + 1 (possibly empty) intervals that span all the columns, and the number of total intervals that work is simply the number of pairs of points that are at least k intervals apart.As we sweep over the xhi coordinate and maintain the list of violists, we want to insert each violist into a sorted list and look at its k nearest neighbors to determine the change in number of intervals. Inserting violists into a sorted list, however, is difficult to do in constant time. Instead, we sweep in reverse. Start with xhi = r and a linked list containing all the desired violists; decrementing xhi is now a simple process of removing the necessary elements from a linked list and examining their neighbors as we do so.Runtime: O(r2k + rnk)627F - Island PuzzleFirst, if we never move the empty pedestal through any cycle, then moving the empty pedestal to and from any given position cannot change the location of the statues, as performing a move in the opposite direction as the previous undoes the previous move.Thus, in our graph with one cycle, we can only do the following two operations: move the empty pedestal from one location to another (without loss of generality, only using the original tree), and cyclically permute the elements along the one cycle (except the element closest to the root).Now, to check satisfiability, we can greedily first move the empty pedestal from its start position to its end position -- since this procedure can be undone, it will never change the satisfiability of the rearrangement. Then, we only have to check that all changed elements lie on a possible cycle. This uniquely determines the edge to be added.To compute the minimum number of moves, we compute the minimum moves to move the empty pedestal from the start to the cycle, the minimum moves to permute the cycle as desired, and the minimum moves from the cycle to the end point.Runtime: O(n)",

          "content": "635A - OrchestraWe can iterate over each possible rectangle and count the number of violists enclosed. This can be optimized with rectangular prefix sums, though the simple brute force is sufficient for this problem.Runtime: O(n6)634A - Island PuzzleNotice that, as we move the empty pedestal around the circle, we cyclically permute the statues (and the empty pedestal can be anywhere). Thus, we can reach one state from another if and only if, after removing the empty pedestal, they are cyclic shifts of each other. The starting and ending configurations are permutations, so we can check this in linear time.Runtime: O(n)627A - XOR EquationFor any two integers a and b, we have , where is the xor and a&b is the bitwise AND. This is because is non-carrying binary addition. Thus, we can find a&b = (s - x) / 2 (if this is not an integer, there are no solutions).Now, for each bit, we have 4 cases: , and . If , then ai = bi, so we have one possibility: ai = bi = ai&bi. If , then we must have ai&bi = 0 (otherwise we print 0), and we have two choices: ai = 1 and bi = 0 or vice versa. Thus, we can return 2n, where n is the number of one-bits in x. (Remember to subtract 2 for the cases a = 0 or b = 0 if necessary.)Runtime: 627B - Factory RepairsUsing two binary-indexed trees, we can maintain the prefix and suffix sums of the amounts we can produce with maximum production rates of B and A, respectively. Then we can just query the binary-indexed trees to find the maximum possible production given the start and end of the repairs.Runtime: .627C - Package DeliveryWe solve this with a greedy algorithm: for each gas station, we fill our tank to min(n, d) liters of gasoline, where d is the distance to the next gas station with cheaper (or equal) gas. This is optimal, as, if we can make it to a station with cheaper gas without buying expensive gas, we should (and fill up our tank at the cheaper station). Otherwise, all stations within range n are more expensive, so we should buy as much gas as possible right now.Alternatively, if we say that we always “use” the gasoline we buy in the order we buy it, then the gasoline used in the ith unit must have been purchased within the last n units. Then we can greedily use the cheapest gas within the last n miles. We can maintain this in a queue with range-min-query, which gives us linear runtime (after sorting).Runtime: 627D - Preorder TestWe binary search on the answer, so we need to answer queries of the following form: is the a depth-first search traversal such that the first k vertices all have value at least v? We can answer this with a greedy tree-DP: for each subtree, we compute whether or not all its vertices have value at least v, and if not, the longest possible prefix with all values at least v. Then, our transition function can be greedy: the maximum possible prefix with all values at least v is the sum of the sizes of all child subtrees which are all at least v plus the largest prefix of all child subtrees.Runtime: 627E - OrchestraWe can think of a rectangle in the grid as a pair of an (xlo, xhi) interval and a (ylo, yhi) interval. Suppose we fix the x-interval and want to determine the number of corresponding y intervals which create rectangles containing at least k violists. Given a sorted list of the y-coordinates of all violists in the range, this is simple: m violists split the y-coordinates into m + 1 (possibly empty) intervals that span all the columns, and the number of total intervals that work is simply the number of pairs of points that are at least k intervals apart.As we sweep over the xhi coordinate and maintain the list of violists, we want to insert each violist into a sorted list and look at its k nearest neighbors to determine the change in number of intervals. Inserting violists into a sorted list, however, is difficult to do in constant time. Instead, we sweep in reverse. Start with xhi = r and a linked list containing all the desired violists; decrementing xhi is now a simple process of removing the necessary elements from a linked list and examining their neighbors as we do so.Runtime: O(r2k + rnk)627F - Island PuzzleFirst, if we never move the empty pedestal through any cycle, then moving the empty pedestal to and from any given position cannot change the location of the statues, as performing a move in the opposite direction as the previous undoes the previous move.Thus, in our graph with one cycle, we can only do the following two operations: move the empty pedestal from one location to another (without loss of generality, only using the original tree), and cyclically permute the elements along the one cycle (except the element closest to the root).Now, to check satisfiability, we can greedily first move the empty pedestal from its start position to its end position -- since this procedure can be undone, it will never change the satisfiability of the rearrangement. Then, we only have to check that all changed elements lie on a possible cycle. This uniquely determines the edge to be added.To compute the minimum number of moves, we compute the minimum moves to move the empty pedestal from the start to the cycle, the minimum moves to permute the cycle as desired, and the minimum moves from the cycle to the end point.Runtime: O(n)",

Thus, we can reach one state from another if and only if, after removing the empty pedestal, they are cyclic shifts of each other. The starting and ending configurations are permutations, so we can check this in linear time.Runtime: O(n)627A - XOR EquationFor any two integers a and b, we have , where is the xor and a&b is the bitwise AND. This is because is non-carrying binary addition. Thus, we can find a&b = (s - x) / 2 (if this is not an integer, there are no solutions).Now, for each bit, we have 4 cases: , and . If , then ai = bi, so we have one possibility: ai = bi = ai&bi. If , then we must have ai&bi = 0 (otherwise we print 0), and we have two choices: ai = 1 and bi = 0 or vice versa. Thus, we can return 2n, where n is the number of one-bits in x. (Remember to subtract 2 for the cases a = 0 or b = 0 if necessary.)Runtime: 627B - Factory RepairsUsing two binary-indexed trees, we can maintain the prefix and suffix sums of the amounts we can produce with maximum production rates of B and A, respectively. Then we can just query the binary-indexed trees to find the maximum possible production given the start and end of the repairs.Runtime: .627C - Package DeliveryWe solve this with a greedy algorithm: for each gas station, we fill our tank to min(n, d) liters of gasoline, where d is the distance to the next gas station with cheaper (or equal) gas. This is optimal, as, if we can make it to a station with cheaper gas without buying expensive gas, we should (and fill up our tank at the cheaper station). Otherwise, all stations within range n are more expensive, so we should buy as much gas as possible right now.Alternatively, if we say that we always “use” the gasoline we buy in the order we buy it, then the gasoline used in the ith unit must have been purchased within the last n units. Then we can greedily use the cheapest gas within the last n miles. We can maintain this in a queue with range-min-query, which gives us linear runtime (after sorting).Runtime: 627D - Preorder TestWe binary search on the answer, so we need to answer queries of the following form: is the a depth-first search traversal such that the first k vertices all have value at least v? We can answer this with a greedy tree-DP: for each subtree, we compute whether or not all its vertices have value at least v, and if not, the longest possible prefix with all values at least v. Then, our transition function can be greedy: the maximum possible prefix with all values at least v is the sum of the sizes of all child subtrees which are all at least v plus the largest prefix of all child subtrees.Runtime: 627E - OrchestraWe can think of a rectangle in the grid as a pair of an (xlo, xhi) interval and a (ylo, yhi) interval. Suppose we fix the x-interval and want to determine the number of corresponding y intervals which create rectangles containing at least k violists. Given a sorted list of the y-coordinates of all violists in the range, this is simple: m violists split the y-coordinates into m + 1 (possibly empty) intervals that span all the columns, and the number of total intervals that work is simply the number of pairs of points that are at least k intervals apart.As we sweep over the xhi coordinate and maintain the list of violists, we want to insert each violist into a sorted list and look at its k nearest neighbors to determine the change in number of intervals. Inserting violists into a sorted list, however, is difficult to do in constant time. Instead, we sweep in reverse. Start with xhi = r and a linked list containing all the desired violists; decrementing xhi is now a simple process of removing the necessary elements from a linked list and examining their neighbors as we do so.Runtime: O(r2k + rnk)627F - Island PuzzleFirst, if we never move the empty pedestal through any cycle, then moving the empty pedestal to and from any given position cannot change the location of the statues, as performing a move in the opposite direction as the previous undoes the previous move.Thus, in our graph with one cycle, we can only do the following two operations: move the empty pedestal from one location to another (without loss of generality, only using the original tree), and cyclically permute the elements along the one cycle (except the element closest to the root).Now, to check satisfiability, we can greedily first move the empty pedestal from its start position to its end position -- since this procedure can be undone, it will never change the satisfiability of the rearrangement. Then, we only have to check that all changed elements lie on a possible cycle. This uniquely determines the edge to be added.To compute the minimum number of moves, we compute the minimum moves to move the empty pedestal from the start to the cycle, the minimum moves to permute the cycle as desired, and the minimum moves from the cycle to the end point.Runtime: O(n)",

          "content": "635A - OrchestraWe can iterate over each possible rectangle and count the number of violists enclosed. This can be optimized with rectangular prefix sums, though the simple brute force is sufficient for this problem.Runtime: O(n6)634A - Island PuzzleNotice that, as we move the empty pedestal around the circle, we cyclically permute the statues (and the empty pedestal can be anywhere). Thus, we can reach one state from another if and only if, after removing the empty pedestal, they are cyclic shifts of each other. The starting and ending configurations are permutations, so we can check this in linear time.Runtime: O(n)627A - XOR EquationFor any two integers a and b, we have , where is the xor and a&b is the bitwise AND. This is because is non-carrying binary addition. Thus, we can find a&b = (s - x) / 2 (if this is not an integer, there are no solutions).Now, for each bit, we have 4 cases: , and . If , then ai = bi, so we have one possibility: ai = bi = ai&bi. If , then we must have ai&bi = 0 (otherwise we print 0), and we have two choices: ai = 1 and bi = 0 or vice versa. Thus, we can return 2n, where n is the number of one-bits in x. (Remember to subtract 2 for the cases a = 0 or b = 0 if necessary.)Runtime: 627B - Factory RepairsUsing two binary-indexed trees, we can maintain the prefix and suffix sums of the amounts we can produce with maximum production rates of B and A, respectively. Then we can just query the binary-indexed trees to find the maximum possible production given the start and end of the repairs.Runtime: .627C - Package DeliveryWe solve this with a greedy algorithm: for each gas station, we fill our tank to min(n, d) liters of gasoline, where d is the distance to the next gas station with cheaper (or equal) gas. This is optimal, as, if we can make it to a station with cheaper gas without buying expensive gas, we should (and fill up our tank at the cheaper station). Otherwise, all stations within range n are more expensive, so we should buy as much gas as possible right now.Alternatively, if we say that we always “use” the gasoline we buy in the order we buy it, then the gasoline used in the ith unit must have been purchased within the last n units. Then we can greedily use the cheapest gas within the last n miles. We can maintain this in a queue with range-min-query, which gives us linear runtime (after sorting).Runtime: 627D - Preorder TestWe binary search on the answer, so we need to answer queries of the following form: is the a depth-first search traversal such that the first k vertices all have value at least v? We can answer this with a greedy tree-DP: for each subtree, we compute whether or not all its vertices have value at least v, and if not, the longest possible prefix with all values at least v. Then, our transition function can be greedy: the maximum possible prefix with all values at least v is the sum of the sizes of all child subtrees which are all at least v plus the largest prefix of all child subtrees.Runtime: 627E - OrchestraWe can think of a rectangle in the grid as a pair of an (xlo, xhi) interval and a (ylo, yhi) interval. Suppose we fix the x-interval and want to determine the number of corresponding y intervals which create rectangles containing at least k violists. Given a sorted list of the y-coordinates of all violists in the range, this is simple: m violists split the y-coordinates into m + 1 (possibly empty) intervals that span all the columns, and the number of total intervals that work is simply the number of pairs of points that are at least k intervals apart.As we sweep over the xhi coordinate and maintain the list of violists, we want to insert each violist into a sorted list and look at its k nearest neighbors to determine the change in number of intervals. Inserting violists into a sorted list, however, is difficult to do in constant time. Instead, we sweep in reverse. Start with xhi = r and a linked list containing all the desired violists; decrementing xhi is now a simple process of removing the necessary elements from a linked list and examining their neighbors as we do so.Runtime: O(r2k + rnk)627F - Island PuzzleFirst, if we never move the empty pedestal through any cycle, then moving the empty pedestal to and from any given position cannot change the location of the statues, as performing a move in the opposite direction as the previous undoes the previous move.Thus, in our graph with one cycle, we can only do the following two operations: move the empty pedestal from one location to another (without loss of generality, only using the original tree), and cyclically permute the elements along the one cycle (except the element closest to the root).Now, to check satisfiability, we can greedily first move the empty pedestal from its start position to its end position -- since this procedure can be undone, it will never change the satisfiability of the rearrangement. Then, we only have to check that all changed elements lie on a possible cycle. This uniquely determines the edge to be added.To compute the minimum number of moves, we compute the minimum moves to move the empty pedestal from the start to the cycle, the minimum moves to permute the cycle as desired, and the minimum moves from the cycle to the end point.Runtime: O(n)",

          "content": "20 марта в 15:00 начнётся второй квалификационный раунд чемпионата VK Cup 2016!Правила этого раунда будут совпадать с правилами Квалификации 1. К участию приглашаются команды, не участвовавшие в первой квалификации или набравшие в ней менее 4800 баллов. Те, кто успешно справился с первой квалификацией, могут принять участие вне конкурса, при этом их результаты никак не будут влиять на проход остальных команд. Разумеется, от команд, участвующих вне конкурса, также требуется соблюдение всех правил Чемпионата.Во время Квалификации 1 нас приятно удивил рост уровня подготовки участников — тот факт, что для прохода необходимо было сдать все четыре задачи, стал для нас большой неожиданностью. Разумеется, мы учли это при подготовке Квалификации 2, посмотрим, как вы справитесь на этот раз :)Раунд продлится 24 часа, такая продолжительность выбрана для того, чтобы все нашли себе удобное время для участия. Квалификационный раунд, как и все предстоящие раунды, требует отдельной регистрации, она будет открыта на протяжении всего раунда.При регистрации на раунд состав вашей команды фиксируется и не подлежит дальнейшей модификации. Вы не сможете в будущем добавить или удалить члена команды. Пожалуйста, перед регистрацией убедитесь, что у вас нет желания изменить состав. Состав команды не сможет быть изменен, даже если вы отмените регистрацию на квалификационный раунд.В Раунд 1 пройдут все команды, которые наберут положительное количество баллов, не меньше количества баллов у команды на 500-м месте.Во время квалификации задачи тестируются системой только на претестах, а системное тестирование состоится после окончания раунда. Обратите внимание, что претесты не покрывают все возможные случаи входных данных, поэтому тщательно тестируйте свои программы! Взломов, падения стоимости задач во время квалификации не будет. Время сдачи задач не будет учитываться, однако будут учитываться штрафные попытки.Категорически запрещается публиковать где-либо условия задач/решения/какие-либо мысли и соображения о них до окончания раунда. Запрещено обсуждать задачи с кем-либо, кроме вашего сокомандника. Будьте честны, пусть в Раунд 1 пройдут сильнейшие!После окончания раунд станет доступен всем для дорешивания, а его задачи попадут в архив, в том числе и на английском языке. Если вы впервые участвуете в соревнованиях подобного рода, ознакомьтесь с одной из задач 158A - Next Round квалификационного раунда чемпионата VK Cup 2012, а также примерами её решения на разных языках программирования: C++: 8130525 C#: 3794163 D: 2060057 Go: 7573616 Haskell: 1265143 Java: 4244817 JavaScript: 5743720 Ocaml: 2698642 Pascal: 5832593 Perl: 9483942 PHP: 4475965 Python: 2475538 Ruby: 7939472 Scala: 2456025 Желаем удачи и удовольствия от решения задач!UPD: Поздравляем все команды, которые набрали 500 или более баллов. Все эти команды приглашаются в Раунд 1 по результатам Квалификации 2. Напоминаем, что Раунд 1 состоится 28.03.2016 в 19:35 (московское время).",

At first, the system displays nobody because nobody is online. There are the following 8 queries:  \"1 3\" — Friend 3 becomes online.  \"2 4\" — We should check if friend 4 is displayed. He isn't even online and thus we print \"NO\".  \"2 3\" — We should check if friend 3 is displayed. Right now he is the only friend online and the system displays him. We should print \"YES\".  \"1 1\" — Friend 1 becomes online. The system now displays both friend 1 and friend 3.  \"1 2\" — Friend 2 becomes online. There are 3 friends online now but we were given k = 2 so only two friends can be displayed. Limak has worse relation with friend 1 than with other two online friends (t1 < t2, t3) so friend 1 won't be displayed  \"2 1\" — Print \"NO\".  \"2 2\" — Print \"YES\".  \"2 3\" — Print \"YES\".",

Just register in your category here. All three rounds will be rated. Div.1 and Div.2 editions will look like normal CF round, but will have common problems with official edition.If you can't register before the round, then you will be able to do it during the contest (but not for the entire duration, you can cheсk it here). Let's thank Mike for this great feature!We want to thank GlebsHP for help in preparing the problems and MikeMirzayanov because without him we wouldn't have such a great platform as Codeforces, where we all can train and develop our passion.You will again help Limak, your favorite bear. This time it may be harder, because evil Radewoosh will try to disturb him.We wish you good luck and great fun! Can't wait to see you during the contest! :DUPD Scoring will be:For VK: 500 — 750 — 1000 — 1500 — 2000 — 3000For Div.2: 500 — 1000 — 1500 — 2000 — 2500For Div.1: 500 — 1000 — 1500 — 2000 — 3000UPD Editorial is ready.UPD Congratulations to the winners!In official VK:1.Never Lucky: subscriber and tourist 2.SobolevTeam: Seyaua and sdya 3.LNU Penguins: witua and RomaWhite 4.Dandelion: Um_nik and sivukhin 5.uıɟɟnɯ ɐuɐuɐq ǝɥʇ ɟo uɹnʇǝɹ╰(º o º╰): enot110 and romanandreevIn Div.11.dotorya 2.kcm1700 3.JoeyWheeler 4.KrK 5.SwistakkAnd in Div.21.osmanorhan 2.nhho 3.fudail225 5.agaga 4.alanMAlso let's thank qwerty787788 and AlexFetisov for testing problems, without them it would be much harder to prepare contest, so give them an applause!",

It's generally good not to write something similar twice because you are more likely to make mistakes. Or maybe later you will find some bug and correct it only in one place. So, try to write calculating score in a function and run them twice. Maybe you will need to reverse the given arrays in some moment.639A - Bear and Displayed Friends — You should remember all friends displayed currently (in set or list) and when you add someone new you must check whether there are at most k people displayed. If there are k + 1 then you can iterate over them (over k + 1 people in your set/list) and find the worst one. Then — remove him. The intended complexity is O(n + q*k).639B - Bear and Forgotten Tree 3 — You may want to write some special if for n = 2. Let's assume n ≥ 3. If d = 1 or d > 2h then there is no answer (it isn't hard to see and prove). Otherwise, let's construct a tree as follows.We need a path of length h starting from vertex 1 and we can just build it. If d > h then we should also add an other path from vertex 1, this one with length d - h. Now we have the required height and diameter but we still maybe have too few vertices used. But what we built is one path of length d where d ≥ 2. You can choose any vertex on this path other than ends of the path (let's call him v), and add new vertices by connecting them all directly with v. You can draw it to see that you won't increase height or diameter this way. In my code I sometimes had v = 1 but sometimes (when d = h) I needed some other vertex and v = 2 was fine.639C - Bear and Polynomials, my favorite problem in this contest. Let's count only ways to decrease one coefficient to get the required conditions (you can later multiply coefficient by  - 1 and run your program again to also calculate ways to increase a coefficient).One way of thinking is to treat the given polynomial as a number. You can find the binary representation — a sequence with 0's and 1's of length at most . Changing one coefficient affects up to consecutive bits there and we want to get a sequence with only 0's. We may succeed only if all 1's are close to each other and otherwise we can print 0 to the output. Let's think what happens when 1's are close to each other.Let's say that we got a sequence with two 1's as follows: ...00101000.... Decreasing by 5 one coefficient (the one that was once in a place of the current first bit 1) will create a sequence of 0's only. It's not complicated to show that decreasing coefficients on the right won't do a job (because the first 1 will remain there) but you should also count some ways to change coefficients on the left. We can decrease by 10 a coefficient on the left from first 1, or decrease by 20 a coefficient even more on the left, and so on. Each time you should check whether changing the original coefficient won't exceed the given maximum allowed value k.One other solution is to go from left to right and keep some integer value — what number should be added to the current coefficient to get sum equal to 0 on the processed prefix. Then, we should do the same from right to left. In both cases maybe in some moment we should break because it's impossible to go any further. In one case it happens when we should (equally) divide an odd number by 2, and in the other case it happens when our number becomes too big (more than 2·109) because we won't be able to make it small again anyway.639D - Bear and Contribution — It isn't enough to sort the input array and use two pointers because it's not correct to assume that the optimal set of people will be an interval. Instead, let's run some solution five times, once for each remainder after dividing by 5 (remainders 0, 1, 2, 3, 4). For each remainder r we assume that we should move k people to some value x that (and at the end we want at least k people to have contribution x). Note that x must be close to some number from the input because otherwise we should decrease x by 5 and for sure we would get better solution. The solution is to iterate over possible values of x from lowest to highest (remember that we fixed remainder ). At the same time, we should keep people in 5 vectors/lists and do something similar to the two pointers technique. We should keep two pointers on each of 5 lists and always move the best among 5 options. The complexity should be O(n·5).639E - Bear and Paradox — It's good to know what to do with problems about optimal order. Often you can use the following trick — take some order and look at two neighbouring elements. When is it good to swap? (When does swapping them increase the score?) You should write some simple formula (high school algebra) and get some inequality. In this problem it turns out that one should sort problems by a fraction and it doesn't depend on a constant c. There may be many problems with the same value of and we can order them however we want (and the question will be: if there is a paradox for at least one order). Let's call such a set of tied problems a block.For each problem you can calculate its minimum and maximum possible number of granted points — one case is at the end of his block and the other case is to solve this problem as early as possible so at the beginning of his block. So, for fixed c for each problem we can find in linear time the best and worst possible scores (given points).When do we get a paradox? Where we have two problems i and j that pi < pj (pi was worth less points) we solved problem i much earlier and later we got less points for problem pj. We can now use some segment tree or sort problems by pi and check whether there is a pair of problems with inequalities we are looking for — pi < pj and maxi > minj where maxi and minj we found in the previous paragraph.We can do the binary search over the answer to get complexity or faster. Can you solve the problem in linear time?639F - Bear and Chemistry — Task is about checking if after adding some edges to graph, some given subset of vertices will be in one biconnected component. Firstly, let's calculate biconnected components in the initial graph. For every vertex in each query we will replace it with index of its bicon-component (for vertices from subset and for edges endpoints). Now we have a forest. When we have a list of interesting vertices in a new graph (bicon-components of vertices from subset or edges) we can compress an entire forest, so it will containg at most 2 times more vertices than the list (from query) and will have simillar structure to forest. To do it, we sort vertices by left-right travelsal order and take LCA of every adjacent pair on the sorted list. If you have compressed forest, then you just have to add edges and calculate biconnected components normally, in linear time.",

Just register in your category here. All three rounds will be rated. Div.1 and Div.2 editions will look like normal CF round, but will have common problems with official edition.If you can't register before the round, then you will be able to do it during the contest (but not for the entire duration, you can cheсk it here). Let's thank Mike for this great feature!We want to thank GlebsHP for help in preparing the problems and MikeMirzayanov because without him we wouldn't have such a great platform as Codeforces, where we all can train and develop our passion.You will again help Limak, your favorite bear. This time it may be harder, because evil Radewoosh will try to disturb him.We wish you good luck and great fun! Can't wait to see you during the contest! :DUPD Scoring will be:For VK: 500 — 750 — 1000 — 1500 — 2000 — 3000For Div.2: 500 — 1000 — 1500 — 2000 — 2500For Div.1: 500 — 1000 — 1500 — 2000 — 3000UPD Editorial is ready.UPD Congratulations to the winners!In official VK:1.Never Lucky: subscriber and tourist 2.SobolevTeam: Seyaua and sdya 3.LNU Penguins: witua and RomaWhite 4.Dandelion: Um_nik and sivukhin 5.uıɟɟnɯ ɐuɐuɐq ǝɥʇ ɟo uɹnʇǝɹ╰(º o º╰): enot110 and romanandreevIn Div.11.dotorya 2.kcm1700 3.JoeyWheeler 4.KrK 5.SwistakkAnd in Div.21.osmanorhan 2.nhho 3.fudail225 5.agaga 4.alanMAlso let's thank qwerty787788 and AlexFetisov for testing problems, without them it would be much harder to prepare contest, so give them an applause!",

It's generally good not to write something similar twice because you are more likely to make mistakes. Or maybe later you will find some bug and correct it only in one place. So, try to write calculating score in a function and run them twice. Maybe you will need to reverse the given arrays in some moment.639A - Bear and Displayed Friends — You should remember all friends displayed currently (in set or list) and when you add someone new you must check whether there are at most k people displayed. If there are k + 1 then you can iterate over them (over k + 1 people in your set/list) and find the worst one. Then — remove him. The intended complexity is O(n + q*k).639B - Bear and Forgotten Tree 3 — You may want to write some special if for n = 2. Let's assume n ≥ 3. If d = 1 or d > 2h then there is no answer (it isn't hard to see and prove). Otherwise, let's construct a tree as follows.We need a path of length h starting from vertex 1 and we can just build it. If d > h then we should also add an other path from vertex 1, this one with length d - h. Now we have the required height and diameter but we still maybe have too few vertices used. But what we built is one path of length d where d ≥ 2. You can choose any vertex on this path other than ends of the path (let's call him v), and add new vertices by connecting them all directly with v. You can draw it to see that you won't increase height or diameter this way. In my code I sometimes had v = 1 but sometimes (when d = h) I needed some other vertex and v = 2 was fine.639C - Bear and Polynomials, my favorite problem in this contest. Let's count only ways to decrease one coefficient to get the required conditions (you can later multiply coefficient by  - 1 and run your program again to also calculate ways to increase a coefficient).One way of thinking is to treat the given polynomial as a number. You can find the binary representation — a sequence with 0's and 1's of length at most . Changing one coefficient affects up to consecutive bits there and we want to get a sequence with only 0's. We may succeed only if all 1's are close to each other and otherwise we can print 0 to the output. Let's think what happens when 1's are close to each other.Let's say that we got a sequence with two 1's as follows: ...00101000.... Decreasing by 5 one coefficient (the one that was once in a place of the current first bit 1) will create a sequence of 0's only. It's not complicated to show that decreasing coefficients on the right won't do a job (because the first 1 will remain there) but you should also count some ways to change coefficients on the left. We can decrease by 10 a coefficient on the left from first 1, or decrease by 20 a coefficient even more on the left, and so on. Each time you should check whether changing the original coefficient won't exceed the given maximum allowed value k.One other solution is to go from left to right and keep some integer value — what number should be added to the current coefficient to get sum equal to 0 on the processed prefix. Then, we should do the same from right to left. In both cases maybe in some moment we should break because it's impossible to go any further. In one case it happens when we should (equally) divide an odd number by 2, and in the other case it happens when our number becomes too big (more than 2·109) because we won't be able to make it small again anyway.639D - Bear and Contribution — It isn't enough to sort the input array and use two pointers because it's not correct to assume that the optimal set of people will be an interval. Instead, let's run some solution five times, once for each remainder after dividing by 5 (remainders 0, 1, 2, 3, 4). For each remainder r we assume that we should move k people to some value x that (and at the end we want at least k people to have contribution x). Note that x must be close to some number from the input because otherwise we should decrease x by 5 and for sure we would get better solution. The solution is to iterate over possible values of x from lowest to highest (remember that we fixed remainder ). At the same time, we should keep people in 5 vectors/lists and do something similar to the two pointers technique. We should keep two pointers on each of 5 lists and always move the best among 5 options. The complexity should be O(n·5).639E - Bear and Paradox — It's good to know what to do with problems about optimal order. Often you can use the following trick — take some order and look at two neighbouring elements. When is it good to swap? (When does swapping them increase the score?) You should write some simple formula (high school algebra) and get some inequality. In this problem it turns out that one should sort problems by a fraction and it doesn't depend on a constant c. There may be many problems with the same value of and we can order them however we want (and the question will be: if there is a paradox for at least one order). Let's call such a set of tied problems a block.For each problem you can calculate its minimum and maximum possible number of granted points — one case is at the end of his block and the other case is to solve this problem as early as possible so at the beginning of his block. So, for fixed c for each problem we can find in linear time the best and worst possible scores (given points).When do we get a paradox? Where we have two problems i and j that pi < pj (pi was worth less points) we solved problem i much earlier and later we got less points for problem pj. We can now use some segment tree or sort problems by pi and check whether there is a pair of problems with inequalities we are looking for — pi < pj and maxi > minj where maxi and minj we found in the previous paragraph.We can do the binary search over the answer to get complexity or faster. Can you solve the problem in linear time?639F - Bear and Chemistry — Task is about checking if after adding some edges to graph, some given subset of vertices will be in one biconnected component. Firstly, let's calculate biconnected components in the initial graph. For every vertex in each query we will replace it with index of its bicon-component (for vertices from subset and for edges endpoints). Now we have a forest. When we have a list of interesting vertices in a new graph (bicon-components of vertices from subset or edges) we can compress an entire forest, so it will containg at most 2 times more vertices than the list (from query) and will have simillar structure to forest. To do it, we sort vertices by left-right travelsal order and take LCA of every adjacent pair on the sorted list. If you have compressed forest, then you just have to add edges and calculate biconnected components normally, in linear time.",

It's generally good not to write something similar twice because you are more likely to make mistakes. Or maybe later you will find some bug and correct it only in one place. So, try to write calculating score in a function and run them twice. Maybe you will need to reverse the given arrays in some moment.639A - Bear and Displayed Friends — You should remember all friends displayed currently (in set or list) and when you add someone new you must check whether there are at most k people displayed. If there are k + 1 then you can iterate over them (over k + 1 people in your set/list) and find the worst one. Then — remove him. The intended complexity is O(n + q*k).639B - Bear and Forgotten Tree 3 — You may want to write some special if for n = 2. Let's assume n ≥ 3. If d = 1 or d > 2h then there is no answer (it isn't hard to see and prove). Otherwise, let's construct a tree as follows.We need a path of length h starting from vertex 1 and we can just build it. If d > h then we should also add an other path from vertex 1, this one with length d - h. Now we have the required height and diameter but we still maybe have too few vertices used. But what we built is one path of length d where d ≥ 2. You can choose any vertex on this path other than ends of the path (let's call him v), and add new vertices by connecting them all directly with v. You can draw it to see that you won't increase height or diameter this way. In my code I sometimes had v = 1 but sometimes (when d = h) I needed some other vertex and v = 2 was fine.639C - Bear and Polynomials, my favorite problem in this contest. Let's count only ways to decrease one coefficient to get the required conditions (you can later multiply coefficient by  - 1 and run your program again to also calculate ways to increase a coefficient).One way of thinking is to treat the given polynomial as a number. You can find the binary representation — a sequence with 0's and 1's of length at most . Changing one coefficient affects up to consecutive bits there and we want to get a sequence with only 0's. We may succeed only if all 1's are close to each other and otherwise we can print 0 to the output. Let's think what happens when 1's are close to each other.Let's say that we got a sequence with two 1's as follows: ...00101000.... Decreasing by 5 one coefficient (the one that was once in a place of the current first bit 1) will create a sequence of 0's only. It's not complicated to show that decreasing coefficients on the right won't do a job (because the first 1 will remain there) but you should also count some ways to change coefficients on the left. We can decrease by 10 a coefficient on the left from first 1, or decrease by 20 a coefficient even more on the left, and so on. Each time you should check whether changing the original coefficient won't exceed the given maximum allowed value k.One other solution is to go from left to right and keep some integer value — what number should be added to the current coefficient to get sum equal to 0 on the processed prefix. Then, we should do the same from right to left. In both cases maybe in some moment we should break because it's impossible to go any further. In one case it happens when we should (equally) divide an odd number by 2, and in the other case it happens when our number becomes too big (more than 2·109) because we won't be able to make it small again anyway.639D - Bear and Contribution — It isn't enough to sort the input array and use two pointers because it's not correct to assume that the optimal set of people will be an interval. Instead, let's run some solution five times, once for each remainder after dividing by 5 (remainders 0, 1, 2, 3, 4). For each remainder r we assume that we should move k people to some value x that (and at the end we want at least k people to have contribution x). Note that x must be close to some number from the input because otherwise we should decrease x by 5 and for sure we would get better solution. The solution is to iterate over possible values of x from lowest to highest (remember that we fixed remainder ). At the same time, we should keep people in 5 vectors/lists and do something similar to the two pointers technique. We should keep two pointers on each of 5 lists and always move the best among 5 options. The complexity should be O(n·5).639E - Bear and Paradox — It's good to know what to do with problems about optimal order. Often you can use the following trick — take some order and look at two neighbouring elements. When is it good to swap? (When does swapping them increase the score?) You should write some simple formula (high school algebra) and get some inequality. In this problem it turns out that one should sort problems by a fraction and it doesn't depend on a constant c. There may be many problems with the same value of and we can order them however we want (and the question will be: if there is a paradox for at least one order). Let's call such a set of tied problems a block.For each problem you can calculate its minimum and maximum possible number of granted points — one case is at the end of his block and the other case is to solve this problem as early as possible so at the beginning of his block. So, for fixed c for each problem we can find in linear time the best and worst possible scores (given points).When do we get a paradox? Where we have two problems i and j that pi < pj (pi was worth less points) we solved problem i much earlier and later we got less points for problem pj. We can now use some segment tree or sort problems by pi and check whether there is a pair of problems with inequalities we are looking for — pi < pj and maxi > minj where maxi and minj we found in the previous paragraph.We can do the binary search over the answer to get complexity or faster. Can you solve the problem in linear time?639F - Bear and Chemistry — Task is about checking if after adding some edges to graph, some given subset of vertices will be in one biconnected component. Firstly, let's calculate biconnected components in the initial graph. For every vertex in each query we will replace it with index of its bicon-component (for vertices from subset and for edges endpoints). Now we have a forest. When we have a list of interesting vertices in a new graph (bicon-components of vertices from subset or edges) we can compress an entire forest, so it will containg at most 2 times more vertices than the list (from query) and will have simillar structure to forest. To do it, we sort vertices by left-right travelsal order and take LCA of every adjacent pair on the sorted list. If you have compressed forest, then you just have to add edges and calculate biconnected components normally, in linear time.",

Limak should behave as follows.  He spends 100 minutes to read one blog of the 4-th user and increase his contribution from 1 to 6.  Then he spends 4·30 = 120 minutes to read four comments of the 2-nd user and increase his contribution from 2 to 6 (four times it was increaded by 1). In the given scenario, Limak spends 100 + 4·30 = 220 minutes and after that each of users 2, 3, 4 has contribution 6.In the second sample, Limak needs 30 minutes to read a blog and 100 minutes to read a comment. This time he can get 3 users with contribution equal to 12 by spending 100 + 3·30 = 190 minutes:  Spend 2·30 = 60 minutes to read two blogs of the 1-st user to increase his contribution from 2 to 12.  Spend 30 + 100 minutes to read one blog and one comment of the 3-rd user. His contribution will change from 6 to 6 + 5 + 1 = 12.",

It's generally good not to write something similar twice because you are more likely to make mistakes. Or maybe later you will find some bug and correct it only in one place. So, try to write calculating score in a function and run them twice. Maybe you will need to reverse the given arrays in some moment.639A - Bear and Displayed Friends — You should remember all friends displayed currently (in set or list) and when you add someone new you must check whether there are at most k people displayed. If there are k + 1 then you can iterate over them (over k + 1 people in your set/list) and find the worst one. Then — remove him. The intended complexity is O(n + q*k).639B - Bear and Forgotten Tree 3 — You may want to write some special if for n = 2. Let's assume n ≥ 3. If d = 1 or d > 2h then there is no answer (it isn't hard to see and prove). Otherwise, let's construct a tree as follows.We need a path of length h starting from vertex 1 and we can just build it. If d > h then we should also add an other path from vertex 1, this one with length d - h. Now we have the required height and diameter but we still maybe have too few vertices used. But what we built is one path of length d where d ≥ 2. You can choose any vertex on this path other than ends of the path (let's call him v), and add new vertices by connecting them all directly with v. You can draw it to see that you won't increase height or diameter this way. In my code I sometimes had v = 1 but sometimes (when d = h) I needed some other vertex and v = 2 was fine.639C - Bear and Polynomials, my favorite problem in this contest. Let's count only ways to decrease one coefficient to get the required conditions (you can later multiply coefficient by  - 1 and run your program again to also calculate ways to increase a coefficient).One way of thinking is to treat the given polynomial as a number. You can find the binary representation — a sequence with 0's and 1's of length at most . Changing one coefficient affects up to consecutive bits there and we want to get a sequence with only 0's. We may succeed only if all 1's are close to each other and otherwise we can print 0 to the output. Let's think what happens when 1's are close to each other.Let's say that we got a sequence with two 1's as follows: ...00101000.... Decreasing by 5 one coefficient (the one that was once in a place of the current first bit 1) will create a sequence of 0's only. It's not complicated to show that decreasing coefficients on the right won't do a job (because the first 1 will remain there) but you should also count some ways to change coefficients on the left. We can decrease by 10 a coefficient on the left from first 1, or decrease by 20 a coefficient even more on the left, and so on. Each time you should check whether changing the original coefficient won't exceed the given maximum allowed value k.One other solution is to go from left to right and keep some integer value — what number should be added to the current coefficient to get sum equal to 0 on the processed prefix. Then, we should do the same from right to left. In both cases maybe in some moment we should break because it's impossible to go any further. In one case it happens when we should (equally) divide an odd number by 2, and in the other case it happens when our number becomes too big (more than 2·109) because we won't be able to make it small again anyway.639D - Bear and Contribution — It isn't enough to sort the input array and use two pointers because it's not correct to assume that the optimal set of people will be an interval. Instead, let's run some solution five times, once for each remainder after dividing by 5 (remainders 0, 1, 2, 3, 4). For each remainder r we assume that we should move k people to some value x that (and at the end we want at least k people to have contribution x). Note that x must be close to some number from the input because otherwise we should decrease x by 5 and for sure we would get better solution. The solution is to iterate over possible values of x from lowest to highest (remember that we fixed remainder ). At the same time, we should keep people in 5 vectors/lists and do something similar to the two pointers technique. We should keep two pointers on each of 5 lists and always move the best among 5 options. The complexity should be O(n·5).639E - Bear and Paradox — It's good to know what to do with problems about optimal order. Often you can use the following trick — take some order and look at two neighbouring elements. When is it good to swap? (When does swapping them increase the score?) You should write some simple formula (high school algebra) and get some inequality. In this problem it turns out that one should sort problems by a fraction and it doesn't depend on a constant c. There may be many problems with the same value of and we can order them however we want (and the question will be: if there is a paradox for at least one order). Let's call such a set of tied problems a block.For each problem you can calculate its minimum and maximum possible number of granted points — one case is at the end of his block and the other case is to solve this problem as early as possible so at the beginning of his block. So, for fixed c for each problem we can find in linear time the best and worst possible scores (given points).When do we get a paradox? Where we have two problems i and j that pi < pj (pi was worth less points) we solved problem i much earlier and later we got less points for problem pj. We can now use some segment tree or sort problems by pi and check whether there is a pair of problems with inequalities we are looking for — pi < pj and maxi > minj where maxi and minj we found in the previous paragraph.We can do the binary search over the answer to get complexity or faster. Can you solve the problem in linear time?639F - Bear and Chemistry — Task is about checking if after adding some edges to graph, some given subset of vertices will be in one biconnected component. Firstly, let's calculate biconnected components in the initial graph. For every vertex in each query we will replace it with index of its bicon-component (for vertices from subset and for edges endpoints). Now we have a forest. When we have a list of interesting vertices in a new graph (bicon-components of vertices from subset or edges) we can compress an entire forest, so it will containg at most 2 times more vertices than the list (from query) and will have simillar structure to forest. To do it, we sort vertices by left-right travelsal order and take LCA of every adjacent pair on the sorted list. If you have compressed forest, then you just have to add edges and calculate biconnected components normally, in linear time.",

Продолжительность контеста равна T = 1 + 1 + 8 = 10.Покажем наличие парадокса при c = 0.7. Решение задач в порядке 1, 2, 3 даст максимальное количество очков, равное:  решение задачи через 1 минуту после начала:   решение задачи через 2 минуты после начала:   решение задачи через 10 минут после начала:  Таким образом, решение задач в таком порядке даёт 3.72 + 2.58 + 3 = 9.3 очков и это единственный оптимальный порядок (можно проверить ответы для других 5 перестановок). Однако, для задач 1 и 3 возникнет парадокс: 4 < 10, но 3.72 > 3. При c = 0.625 парадокса нет и это максимальное такое значение c.Во втором примере, все 24 порядка решения задач являются оптимальными.В третьем примере не возникнет парадокса даже при c = 1.",

          "content": "В понедельник, 28-го марта, в 19:35 будет дан старт Раунду 1 чемпионата по программированию VK Cup 2016! Я (Radewoosh) и Kamil Dębowski (Errichto) подготовили для вас комплект задач к этому раунду.Не забудьте зарегистрировать вашу команду на раунд, регистрация закроется за пять минут до его старта (но позже будет продлена в дополнительное время).В этом раунде могут принять все те команды, которые прошли квалификацию. Напомним, что из первой квалификации допущены все те команды, что набрали не менее 4800 баллов. Таких оказалось 505. Вторую квалификацию прошли 956 команд, все те, что набрали не менее 500 баллов. Таким образом, принять участие в Раунде 1 могут 1461 команды!Участников ждет соревнование по правилам классических раундов Codeforces с некоторыми адаптациями: в Раунде 1 будут участвовать команды по 1 или 2 человека, разрешается любая коммуникация внутри команды, но какое-либо общение с другими лицами по прежнему, конечно, запрещено; каждая команда может использовать один или более компьютеров по своему усмотрению (напомним, что в Финале команде будет дана возможность использовать только один компьютер); для членов команды рейтинг будет пересчитан одинаково, исходя из рейтинга команды (учитываются зарегистрированные на раунд члены команды), о подсчете рейтинга команды можно почитать здесь. Отметим, что одновременно с официальным раундом чемпионата будут проведены онлайн-трансляции: VK Cup 2016 — Round 1 (редакция для Div. 1) и VK Cup 2016 — Round 1 (редакция для Div. 2). Фактически это будут классические Codeforces-раунды для всех тех из вас, кто не участвует в VK Cup 2016 или не прошел квалификацию.Все три варианта проведения будут рейтинговыми.Мы хотим поблагодарить GlebsHP за помощь в подготовке задач и MikeMirzayanov, потому что без него бы не было замечательной платформы Codeforces, где мы соревнуемся и тренируемся.В понедельник вам предстоит снова помочь Лимаку, вашему любимому медведю. В этот раз это, возможно, будет чуть сложнее, ведь злой Радевуш будет пытаться мешать Лимаку.Напомним, что в Раунд 2 пройдут все те команды, которые наберут положительный балл не меньший, чем у команды на 400-м месте.Желаем удачи и интересного соревнования!UPD Разбалловка:For VK: 500 — 750 — 1000 — 1500 — 2000 — 3000For Div.2: 500 — 1000 — 1500 — 2000 — 2500For Div.1: 500 — 1000 — 1500 — 2000 — 3000UPD Разбор уже готов.UPD Поздравляем победителей!В чемпионате VK Cup:1.Never Lucky: subscriber и tourist 2.SobolevTeam: Seyaua и sdya 3.LNU Penguins: witua и RomaWhite 4.Dandelion: Um_nik и sivukhin 5.uıɟɟnɯ ɐuɐuɐq ǝɥʇ ɟo uɹnʇǝɹ╰(º o º╰): enot110 и romanandreevВ Div.11.dotorya 2.kcm1700 3.JoeyWheeler 4.KrK 5.SwistakkИ в Div.21.osmanorhan 2.nhho 3.fudail225 5.agaga 4.alanMОтдельное спасибо qwerty787788 и AlexFetisov за тестирование задач, ценные советы и рекомендации!",

          "content": "Codes in nicer format will be uploaded later.658A - Bear and Reverse Radewoosh and 639A - Bear and Displayed Friends — codes.639B - Bear and Forgotten Tree 3 and 639C - Bear and Polynomials — codes.639D - Bear and Contribution — codes.639E - Bear and Paradox — codes.639F - Bear and Chemistry — codes.658A - Bear and Reverse Radewoosh — Iterate once from left to right to calculate one player's score and then iterate from right to left. It's generally good not to write something similar twice because you are more likely to make mistakes. Or maybe later you will find some bug and correct it only in one place. So, try to write calculating score in a function and run them twice. Maybe you will need to reverse the given arrays in some moment.639A - Bear and Displayed Friends — You should remember all friends displayed currently (in set or list) and when you add someone new you must check whether there are at most k people displayed. If there are k + 1 then you can iterate over them (over k + 1 people in your set/list) and find the worst one. Then — remove him. The intended complexity is O(n + q*k).639B - Bear and Forgotten Tree 3 — You may want to write some special if for n = 2. Let's assume n ≥ 3. If d = 1 or d > 2h then there is no answer (it isn't hard to see and prove). Otherwise, let's construct a tree as follows.We need a path of length h starting from vertex 1 and we can just build it. If d > h then we should also add an other path from vertex 1, this one with length d - h. Now we have the required height and diameter but we still maybe have too few vertices used. But what we built is one path of length d where d ≥ 2. You can choose any vertex on this path other than ends of the path (let's call him v), and add new vertices by connecting them all directly with v. You can draw it to see that you won't increase height or diameter this way. In my code I sometimes had v = 1 but sometimes (when d = h) I needed some other vertex and v = 2 was fine.639C - Bear and Polynomials, my favorite problem in this contest. Let's count only ways to decrease one coefficient to get the required conditions (you can later multiply coefficient by  - 1 and run your program again to also calculate ways to increase a coefficient).One way of thinking is to treat the given polynomial as a number. You can find the binary representation — a sequence with 0's and 1's of length at most . Changing one coefficient affects up to consecutive bits there and we want to get a sequence with only 0's. We may succeed only if all 1's are close to each other and otherwise we can print 0 to the output. Let's think what happens when 1's are close to each other.Let's say that we got a sequence with two 1's as follows: ...00101000.... Decreasing by 5 one coefficient (the one that was once in a place of the current first bit 1) will create a sequence of 0's only. It's not complicated to show that decreasing coefficients on the right won't do a job (because the first 1 will remain there) but you should also count some ways to change coefficients on the left. We can decrease by 10 a coefficient on the left from first 1, or decrease by 20 a coefficient even more on the left, and so on. Each time you should check whether changing the original coefficient won't exceed the given maximum allowed value k.One other solution is to go from left to right and keep some integer value — what number should be added to the current coefficient to get sum equal to 0 on the processed prefix. Then, we should do the same from right to left. In both cases maybe in some moment we should break because it's impossible to go any further. In one case it happens when we should (equally) divide an odd number by 2, and in the other case it happens when our number becomes too big (more than 2·109) because we won't be able to make it small again anyway.639D - Bear and Contribution — It isn't enough to sort the input array and use two pointers because it's not correct to assume that the optimal set of people will be an interval. Instead, let's run some solution five times, once for each remainder after dividing by 5 (remainders 0, 1, 2, 3, 4). For each remainder r we assume that we should move k people to some value x that (and at the end we want at least k people to have contribution x). Note that x must be close to some number from the input because otherwise we should decrease x by 5 and for sure we would get better solution. The solution is to iterate over possible values of x from lowest to highest (remember that we fixed remainder ). At the same time, we should keep people in 5 vectors/lists and do something similar to the two pointers technique. We should keep two pointers on each of 5 lists and always move the best among 5 options. The complexity should be O(n·5).639E - Bear and Paradox — It's good to know what to do with problems about optimal order. Often you can use the following trick — take some order and look at two neighbouring elements. When is it good to swap? (When does swapping them increase the score?) You should write some simple formula (high school algebra) and get some inequality. In this problem it turns out that one should sort problems by a fraction and it doesn't depend on a constant c. There may be many problems with the same value of and we can order them however we want (and the question will be: if there is a paradox for at least one order). Let's call such a set of tied problems a block.For each problem you can calculate its minimum and maximum possible number of granted points — one case is at the end of his block and the other case is to solve this problem as early as possible so at the beginning of his block. So, for fixed c for each problem we can find in linear time the best and worst possible scores (given points).When do we get a paradox? Where we have two problems i and j that pi < pj (pi was worth less points) we solved problem i much earlier and later we got less points for problem pj. We can now use some segment tree or sort problems by pi and check whether there is a pair of problems with inequalities we are looking for — pi < pj and maxi > minj where maxi and minj we found in the previous paragraph.We can do the binary search over the answer to get complexity or faster. Can you solve the problem in linear time?639F - Bear and Chemistry — Task is about checking if after adding some edges to graph, some given subset of vertices will be in one biconnected component. Firstly, let's calculate biconnected components in the initial graph. For every vertex in each query we will replace it with index of its bicon-component (for vertices from subset and for edges endpoints). Now we have a forest. When we have a list of interesting vertices in a new graph (bicon-components of vertices from subset or edges) we can compress an entire forest, so it will containg at most 2 times more vertices than the list (from query) and will have simillar structure to forest. To do it, we sort vertices by left-right travelsal order and take LCA of every adjacent pair on the sorted list. If you have compressed forest, then you just have to add edges and calculate biconnected components normally, in linear time.",

Limak can tranform element 4 into 2 (so half of a task is complete) and then 2 into 3, and 3 into 4. Answer is \"YES\", so R is increased by 1.In second gossip set in the input is denoted by {6, 2} and machine by (3, 4), but R is equal to 1, so set is {1, 3} and machine is (4, 5). Answer is \"NO\", so R isn't changed.In third gossip set {6, 4, 3} and machines (2, 5) and (4, 6) are deciphered to be {1, 5, 4}, (3, 6) and (5, 1).Consider Radewoosh's choices:   If he chooses elements 1 and 5, then Limak is able to transform 1 into 5, then 6 into 3, 3 into 2 and 2 into 1. If he chooses elements 5 and 4, then Limak is able to transform 5 into 6, 6 into 3, 3 into 4 (half way already behind him), 4 into 2, 2 into 1, 1 into 5. If he chooses elements 1 and 4, then Limak is able to transform 1 into 2, 2 into 4, 4 into 3, 3 into 6, 6 into 5 and 5 into 1. So Limak is able to execute task. Answer is \"YES\" and R is increased by 3 (it's equal to 4 now).In last gossip {1, 2} and (1, 2) are deciphered to be {5, 6} and (5, 6). Now there are 2 machines (5, 6) so Limak is able to execute task again.",

Just register in your category here. All three rounds will be rated. Div.1 and Div.2 editions will look like normal CF round, but will have common problems with official edition.If you can't register before the round, then you will be able to do it during the contest (but not for the entire duration, you can cheсk it here). Let's thank Mike for this great feature!We want to thank GlebsHP for help in preparing the problems and MikeMirzayanov because without him we wouldn't have such a great platform as Codeforces, where we all can train and develop our passion.You will again help Limak, your favorite bear. This time it may be harder, because evil Radewoosh will try to disturb him.We wish you good luck and great fun! Can't wait to see you during the contest! :DUPD Scoring will be:For VK: 500 — 750 — 1000 — 1500 — 2000 — 3000For Div.2: 500 — 1000 — 1500 — 2000 — 2500For Div.1: 500 — 1000 — 1500 — 2000 — 3000UPD Editorial is ready.UPD Congratulations to the winners!In official VK:1.Never Lucky: subscriber and tourist 2.SobolevTeam: Seyaua and sdya 3.LNU Penguins: witua and RomaWhite 4.Dandelion: Um_nik and sivukhin 5.uıɟɟnɯ ɐuɐuɐq ǝɥʇ ɟo uɹnʇǝɹ╰(º o º╰): enot110 and romanandreevIn Div.11.dotorya 2.kcm1700 3.JoeyWheeler 4.KrK 5.SwistakkAnd in Div.21.osmanorhan 2.nhho 3.fudail225 5.agaga 4.alanMAlso let's thank qwerty787788 and AlexFetisov for testing problems, without them it would be much harder to prepare contest, so give them an applause!",

It's generally good not to write something similar twice because you are more likely to make mistakes. Or maybe later you will find some bug and correct it only in one place. So, try to write calculating score in a function and run them twice. Maybe you will need to reverse the given arrays in some moment.639A - Bear and Displayed Friends — You should remember all friends displayed currently (in set or list) and when you add someone new you must check whether there are at most k people displayed. If there are k + 1 then you can iterate over them (over k + 1 people in your set/list) and find the worst one. Then — remove him. The intended complexity is O(n + q*k).639B - Bear and Forgotten Tree 3 — You may want to write some special if for n = 2. Let's assume n ≥ 3. If d = 1 or d > 2h then there is no answer (it isn't hard to see and prove). Otherwise, let's construct a tree as follows.We need a path of length h starting from vertex 1 and we can just build it. If d > h then we should also add an other path from vertex 1, this one with length d - h. Now we have the required height and diameter but we still maybe have too few vertices used. But what we built is one path of length d where d ≥ 2. You can choose any vertex on this path other than ends of the path (let's call him v), and add new vertices by connecting them all directly with v. You can draw it to see that you won't increase height or diameter this way. In my code I sometimes had v = 1 but sometimes (when d = h) I needed some other vertex and v = 2 was fine.639C - Bear and Polynomials, my favorite problem in this contest. Let's count only ways to decrease one coefficient to get the required conditions (you can later multiply coefficient by  - 1 and run your program again to also calculate ways to increase a coefficient).One way of thinking is to treat the given polynomial as a number. You can find the binary representation — a sequence with 0's and 1's of length at most . Changing one coefficient affects up to consecutive bits there and we want to get a sequence with only 0's. We may succeed only if all 1's are close to each other and otherwise we can print 0 to the output. Let's think what happens when 1's are close to each other.Let's say that we got a sequence with two 1's as follows: ...00101000.... Decreasing by 5 one coefficient (the one that was once in a place of the current first bit 1) will create a sequence of 0's only. It's not complicated to show that decreasing coefficients on the right won't do a job (because the first 1 will remain there) but you should also count some ways to change coefficients on the left. We can decrease by 10 a coefficient on the left from first 1, or decrease by 20 a coefficient even more on the left, and so on. Each time you should check whether changing the original coefficient won't exceed the given maximum allowed value k.One other solution is to go from left to right and keep some integer value — what number should be added to the current coefficient to get sum equal to 0 on the processed prefix. Then, we should do the same from right to left. In both cases maybe in some moment we should break because it's impossible to go any further. In one case it happens when we should (equally) divide an odd number by 2, and in the other case it happens when our number becomes too big (more than 2·109) because we won't be able to make it small again anyway.639D - Bear and Contribution — It isn't enough to sort the input array and use two pointers because it's not correct to assume that the optimal set of people will be an interval. Instead, let's run some solution five times, once for each remainder after dividing by 5 (remainders 0, 1, 2, 3, 4). For each remainder r we assume that we should move k people to some value x that (and at the end we want at least k people to have contribution x). Note that x must be close to some number from the input because otherwise we should decrease x by 5 and for sure we would get better solution. The solution is to iterate over possible values of x from lowest to highest (remember that we fixed remainder ). At the same time, we should keep people in 5 vectors/lists and do something similar to the two pointers technique. We should keep two pointers on each of 5 lists and always move the best among 5 options. The complexity should be O(n·5).639E - Bear and Paradox — It's good to know what to do with problems about optimal order. Often you can use the following trick — take some order and look at two neighbouring elements. When is it good to swap? (When does swapping them increase the score?) You should write some simple formula (high school algebra) and get some inequality. In this problem it turns out that one should sort problems by a fraction and it doesn't depend on a constant c. There may be many problems with the same value of and we can order them however we want (and the question will be: if there is a paradox for at least one order). Let's call such a set of tied problems a block.For each problem you can calculate its minimum and maximum possible number of granted points — one case is at the end of his block and the other case is to solve this problem as early as possible so at the beginning of his block. So, for fixed c for each problem we can find in linear time the best and worst possible scores (given points).When do we get a paradox? Where we have two problems i and j that pi < pj (pi was worth less points) we solved problem i much earlier and later we got less points for problem pj. We can now use some segment tree or sort problems by pi and check whether there is a pair of problems with inequalities we are looking for — pi < pj and maxi > minj where maxi and minj we found in the previous paragraph.We can do the binary search over the answer to get complexity or faster. Can you solve the problem in linear time?639F - Bear and Chemistry — Task is about checking if after adding some edges to graph, some given subset of vertices will be in one biconnected component. Firstly, let's calculate biconnected components in the initial graph. For every vertex in each query we will replace it with index of its bicon-component (for vertices from subset and for edges endpoints). Now we have a forest. When we have a list of interesting vertices in a new graph (bicon-components of vertices from subset or edges) we can compress an entire forest, so it will containg at most 2 times more vertices than the list (from query) and will have simillar structure to forest. To do it, we sort vertices by left-right travelsal order and take LCA of every adjacent pair on the sorted list. If you have compressed forest, then you just have to add edges and calculate biconnected components normally, in linear time.",

          "title": "VK Cup 2016 — Раунд 2 (editorial) - Codeforces",
          "content": "Problem A (div2):It is obvious that we need to make sequence of moves like: 1, 2, 1, 2, ...So the answer is 2 * n / 3. After that we have either 0, 1 or 2 stones left. If we have 0, we are done, otherwise we have 1 or 2 left, so we only can give 1 more stone.Final formula is: (2 * n) / 3 + (n % 3 != 0 ? 1 : 0);Problem B (div2):We can just emulate grasshopper behavior and save all positions it visits. It is obvious that we will have no more than O(n) different positions. If grasshopper appears in the same position twice that means that there is a loop and the answer is INFINITE. Otherwise the answer is FINITE. Problem A(div1)/C(div2):Let's have 2 matrices: a, idx. In a we will have NULL for cell if we don't know the value or the value. idx will be initialized with idx[i][j] = {i, j}; Then we need to emulate the process on matrix idx. If we have 3rd query we can set up the value in matrix a, because we know the original position of that cell keeping idx.Problem B(div1)/D(div2):The key in this problem is that order of all elements in odd positions and in even positions is the same. Let's say we have 2 arrays: [1, 3, 5, ...] and [2, 4, ...] (odd positions and even positions). Now if we call 2nd commands we just swap these 2 arrays, but order is the same. Obviously 1st command also keeps the order. By order I mean cyclic order (right neighbor is the same in cycle position).Let's just keep the position of 1st boy and 2nd boy. Now if we apply 1st operation we move it by X or -X. Second type of the query just swaps the positions. In the end we can construct the answer if we know positions of 1st and 2nd boys.Problem C(div1):First, let's solve inverse problem: find minimum (maximum) of two distributions. Let's use the following formulas:P(a = k) = P(a <= k) — P(a <= k-1) P(max(a, b) <= k) = P(a <= k) * P(b <= k)For minimum:P(min(a, b) >= k) = P(a >= k) * P(b >= k) = (1 — P(a <= k-1)) *(1 — P(b <= k-1))Now in our original problem minimum and maximum defines system of square equations for each pair P(a <= k), P(b <= k).Solving these equations we get P(a<=k), P(b<=k) = (u + v ± sqrt((u + v)^2 — 4u)) / 2, where u = P(max(a,b) <= k), v = P(min(a,b) <= k). Now we can notice that if there exists an answer, then there exists an answer when we chose the signs for each pair equally (check out this comment)Problem D(div1)/E(div2):There are many ways to solve this problem. One of the ways was SQRT-decomposition. First let's compress all times. Now for each block in the decomposition we will store for each element the balance in that block. So to answer the query we need to calculate sum of balances from first block to the block before the one where our element is located and then just process all requests in the current block.Another way was to use data structure from std library, described here. For each element we have two trees: remove times and add times. Then by getting order of the time in remove and add tree we can calculate the answer.Problem E(div1):Let's build for both 2-SAT formulas implication graph and let's find strong connected components in this graph. If both of the formulas are not satisfiable then the answer is SIMILAR. If only one formula is not satisfiable then we can find an answer for the second one and output it.Now, let's assume both formulas are satisfiable. Let's have a transitive closure for both of the graphs. Let's call the variable X fixed in the formula F if there is a path -> x or (x -> ). If there is a fixed variable in one formula, but not fixed in the other (or fixed but has other value) we can find the solution for that second formula with opposite value of that fixed variable — that will be an answer. If we could not find these variables, we can remove all of them. There is no fixed variables in the rest of them. Let's find an edge u->v, presented in one graph, but not presented in the other. Let's find the solution for formula without the edge with u = 1 and v = 0 (we always can find it). That is the answer.Problem F(div1):Let's define k-clique B the descendant of k-clique A, if B could be produced from A with the sequence of the following steps: add vertex to the clique, connected with all clique vertices in the graph description and remove exactly one other vertex. Let's calculate the DP with states (k-clique, separation its vertices to the components) — number of spanning forests int the graph, induced by the clique and all its descendants so that clique will be divided to different connected components according to the defined vertices separation (all of the rest vertices will be connected with some of these components). To calculate that we need to precalculate all separations from k to k+1 elements and transitions:1) (separation of k+1 vertices) x (separation k+1 vertices) -> (separation k+1 vertices | null), transform pair of separations — forests to the set of connected components of their union or null if there appears a cycle.2) (separation of k+1 vertices) x (vertex) -> (separation of k+1 vertices | null), transform forest to the new forest, generated by adding new edge from vertex to vertex k+1 (or null, if there appears a cycle)3) (separation of k+1 vertices) -> (separation of k vertices | null), projecting the separation on the first k vertices (or null, if k+1-th vertex creates a separate component)Check out details in the author solution.",

          "content": "Problem A (div2):It is obvious that we need to make sequence of moves like: 1, 2, 1, 2, ...So the answer is 2 * n / 3. After that we have either 0, 1 or 2 stones left. If we have 0, we are done, otherwise we have 1 or 2 left, so we only can give 1 more stone.Final formula is: (2 * n) / 3 + (n % 3 != 0 ? 1 : 0);Problem B (div2):We can just emulate grasshopper behavior and save all positions it visits. It is obvious that we will have no more than O(n) different positions. If grasshopper appears in the same position twice that means that there is a loop and the answer is INFINITE. Otherwise the answer is FINITE. Problem A(div1)/C(div2):Let's have 2 matrices: a, idx. In a we will have NULL for cell if we don't know the value or the value. idx will be initialized with idx[i][j] = {i, j}; Then we need to emulate the process on matrix idx. If we have 3rd query we can set up the value in matrix a, because we know the original position of that cell keeping idx.Problem B(div1)/D(div2):The key in this problem is that order of all elements in odd positions and in even positions is the same. Let's say we have 2 arrays: [1, 3, 5, ...] and [2, 4, ...] (odd positions and even positions). Now if we call 2nd commands we just swap these 2 arrays, but order is the same. Obviously 1st command also keeps the order. By order I mean cyclic order (right neighbor is the same in cycle position).Let's just keep the position of 1st boy and 2nd boy. Now if we apply 1st operation we move it by X or -X. Second type of the query just swaps the positions. In the end we can construct the answer if we know positions of 1st and 2nd boys.Problem C(div1):First, let's solve inverse problem: find minimum (maximum) of two distributions. Let's use the following formulas:P(a = k) = P(a <= k) — P(a <= k-1) P(max(a, b) <= k) = P(a <= k) * P(b <= k)For minimum:P(min(a, b) >= k) = P(a >= k) * P(b >= k) = (1 — P(a <= k-1)) *(1 — P(b <= k-1))Now in our original problem minimum and maximum defines system of square equations for each pair P(a <= k), P(b <= k).Solving these equations we get P(a<=k), P(b<=k) = (u + v ± sqrt((u + v)^2 — 4u)) / 2, where u = P(max(a,b) <= k), v = P(min(a,b) <= k). Now we can notice that if there exists an answer, then there exists an answer when we chose the signs for each pair equally (check out this comment)Problem D(div1)/E(div2):There are many ways to solve this problem. One of the ways was SQRT-decomposition. First let's compress all times. Now for each block in the decomposition we will store for each element the balance in that block. So to answer the query we need to calculate sum of balances from first block to the block before the one where our element is located and then just process all requests in the current block.Another way was to use data structure from std library, described here. For each element we have two trees: remove times and add times. Then by getting order of the time in remove and add tree we can calculate the answer.Problem E(div1):Let's build for both 2-SAT formulas implication graph and let's find strong connected components in this graph. If both of the formulas are not satisfiable then the answer is SIMILAR. If only one formula is not satisfiable then we can find an answer for the second one and output it.Now, let's assume both formulas are satisfiable. Let's have a transitive closure for both of the graphs. Let's call the variable X fixed in the formula F if there is a path -> x or (x -> ). If there is a fixed variable in one formula, but not fixed in the other (or fixed but has other value) we can find the solution for that second formula with opposite value of that fixed variable — that will be an answer. If we could not find these variables, we can remove all of them. There is no fixed variables in the rest of them. Let's find an edge u->v, presented in one graph, but not presented in the other. Let's find the solution for formula without the edge with u = 1 and v = 0 (we always can find it). That is the answer.Problem F(div1):Let's define k-clique B the descendant of k-clique A, if B could be produced from A with the sequence of the following steps: add vertex to the clique, connected with all clique vertices in the graph description and remove exactly one other vertex. Let's calculate the DP with states (k-clique, separation its vertices to the components) — number of spanning forests int the graph, induced by the clique and all its descendants so that clique will be divided to different connected components according to the defined vertices separation (all of the rest vertices will be connected with some of these components). To calculate that we need to precalculate all separations from k to k+1 elements and transitions:1) (separation of k+1 vertices) x (separation k+1 vertices) -> (separation k+1 vertices | null), transform pair of separations — forests to the set of connected components of their union or null if there appears a cycle.2) (separation of k+1 vertices) x (vertex) -> (separation of k+1 vertices | null), transform forest to the new forest, generated by adding new edge from vertex to vertex k+1 (or null, if there appears a cycle)3) (separation of k+1 vertices) -> (separation of k vertices | null), projecting the separation on the first k vertices (or null, if k+1-th vertex creates a separate component)Check out details in the author solution.",

          "content": "Problem A (div2):It is obvious that we need to make sequence of moves like: 1, 2, 1, 2, ...So the answer is 2 * n / 3. After that we have either 0, 1 or 2 stones left. If we have 0, we are done, otherwise we have 1 or 2 left, so we only can give 1 more stone.Final formula is: (2 * n) / 3 + (n % 3 != 0 ? 1 : 0);Problem B (div2):We can just emulate grasshopper behavior and save all positions it visits. It is obvious that we will have no more than O(n) different positions. If grasshopper appears in the same position twice that means that there is a loop and the answer is INFINITE. Otherwise the answer is FINITE. Problem A(div1)/C(div2):Let's have 2 matrices: a, idx. In a we will have NULL for cell if we don't know the value or the value. idx will be initialized with idx[i][j] = {i, j}; Then we need to emulate the process on matrix idx. If we have 3rd query we can set up the value in matrix a, because we know the original position of that cell keeping idx.Problem B(div1)/D(div2):The key in this problem is that order of all elements in odd positions and in even positions is the same. Let's say we have 2 arrays: [1, 3, 5, ...] and [2, 4, ...] (odd positions and even positions). Now if we call 2nd commands we just swap these 2 arrays, but order is the same. Obviously 1st command also keeps the order. By order I mean cyclic order (right neighbor is the same in cycle position).Let's just keep the position of 1st boy and 2nd boy. Now if we apply 1st operation we move it by X or -X. Second type of the query just swaps the positions. In the end we can construct the answer if we know positions of 1st and 2nd boys.Problem C(div1):First, let's solve inverse problem: find minimum (maximum) of two distributions. Let's use the following formulas:P(a = k) = P(a <= k) — P(a <= k-1) P(max(a, b) <= k) = P(a <= k) * P(b <= k)For minimum:P(min(a, b) >= k) = P(a >= k) * P(b >= k) = (1 — P(a <= k-1)) *(1 — P(b <= k-1))Now in our original problem minimum and maximum defines system of square equations for each pair P(a <= k), P(b <= k).Solving these equations we get P(a<=k), P(b<=k) = (u + v ± sqrt((u + v)^2 — 4u)) / 2, where u = P(max(a,b) <= k), v = P(min(a,b) <= k). Now we can notice that if there exists an answer, then there exists an answer when we chose the signs for each pair equally (check out this comment)Problem D(div1)/E(div2):There are many ways to solve this problem. One of the ways was SQRT-decomposition. First let's compress all times. Now for each block in the decomposition we will store for each element the balance in that block. So to answer the query we need to calculate sum of balances from first block to the block before the one where our element is located and then just process all requests in the current block.Another way was to use data structure from std library, described here. For each element we have two trees: remove times and add times. Then by getting order of the time in remove and add tree we can calculate the answer.Problem E(div1):Let's build for both 2-SAT formulas implication graph and let's find strong connected components in this graph. If both of the formulas are not satisfiable then the answer is SIMILAR. If only one formula is not satisfiable then we can find an answer for the second one and output it.Now, let's assume both formulas are satisfiable. Let's have a transitive closure for both of the graphs. Let's call the variable X fixed in the formula F if there is a path -> x or (x -> ). If there is a fixed variable in one formula, but not fixed in the other (or fixed but has other value) we can find the solution for that second formula with opposite value of that fixed variable — that will be an answer. If we could not find these variables, we can remove all of them. There is no fixed variables in the rest of them. Let's find an edge u->v, presented in one graph, but not presented in the other. Let's find the solution for formula without the edge with u = 1 and v = 0 (we always can find it). That is the answer.Problem F(div1):Let's define k-clique B the descendant of k-clique A, if B could be produced from A with the sequence of the following steps: add vertex to the clique, connected with all clique vertices in the graph description and remove exactly one other vertex. Let's calculate the DP with states (k-clique, separation its vertices to the components) — number of spanning forests int the graph, induced by the clique and all its descendants so that clique will be divided to different connected components according to the defined vertices separation (all of the rest vertices will be connected with some of these components). To calculate that we need to precalculate all separations from k to k+1 elements and transitions:1) (separation of k+1 vertices) x (separation k+1 vertices) -> (separation k+1 vertices | null), transform pair of separations — forests to the set of connected components of their union or null if there appears a cycle.2) (separation of k+1 vertices) x (vertex) -> (separation of k+1 vertices | null), transform forest to the new forest, generated by adding new edge from vertex to vertex k+1 (or null, if there appears a cycle)3) (separation of k+1 vertices) -> (separation of k vertices | null), projecting the separation on the first k vertices (or null, if k+1-th vertex creates a separate component)Check out details in the author solution.",

Есть дополнительная регистрация!В этом раунде могут принять участие все те команды, которые отобрались в Раунде 1 или в Уайлд-кард раунде 1. Участников ждет соревнование по правилам классических раундов Codeforces. Одновременно с основным раундом будет проведена интернет-трансляция, которая представляет из себя обычный рейтинговый div1/div2-раунд по правилам Codeforces. В трансляции может участвовать любой участник, не зарегистрированный на основной раунд в составе отобравшейся команды.Раунд для вас подготовили AlexFetisov и winger. Это первый для нас раунд на Codeforces в качестве авторов. Огромное спасибо Глебу Евстропову (GlebsHP) за долгое сотруднечество и помощь в приготовлении раунда. Глеб делает колоссальную работу, и я хотел бы это отметить еще один раз! Также большое спасибо Kamil Debowski (Errichto), Mateusz Radecki (Radewoosh), Боре Минаеву (qwerty787788), Паше Кунявскому (PavelKunyavskiy) за прорешивание задач и дельные советы. Огромное спасибо Мише Мирзаянову (MikeMirzayanov) за все, что он сделал для всех нас!Напомним, что в Раунд 3 пройдут все те команды, которые наберут положительный балл, не меньший, чем у команды на 100-м месте. Также обращаем ваше внимание, что все команды, проходящие в Раунд 3, получат фирменную футболку Чемпионата. Помимо этого, фирменной футболкой будут награждены топ-50 участников интернет-трансляции Раунда 3.Желаем удачи и интересной борьбы!ОбновлениеРаунд завершен. Надеюсь, задачи вам понравились!

          "content": "Задача A (div2):Очевидно, что нам необходимо делать последовательность ходов вида: 1, 2, 1, 2, ...Ответ будет примерно равен 2 * n / 3. После этого у нас останется 0, 1 или 2 камня. Если у нас осталось 0 камней, то все закончилось, иначе у нас осталось либо 1, либо 2 камня и очевидно, что мы можем в этих случаях взять только 1 камень.Итоговый ответ: 2 * n / 3 + (n % 3 != 0 ? 1 : 0);Задача B (div2):Мы можем просто симулировать поведение кузнечика и отмечать все позиции, на которых он был. Очевидно, что таких различных позиций будет O(n). Если кузнечик попадет на клетку, где он уже был, то мы попали в цикл, и ответ — INFINITE. Иначе — FINITE. Задача A(div1)/C(div2):Давайте заведем 2 матрицы: a, idx. В матрице a мы будем хранить NULL для ячеек, о которых мы ничего не знаем или значение, если мы уже его определили. idx будет инициализировано как idx[i][j] = {i, j}; Затем просто просимулируем процесс для матрицы idx. Для запросов 3-его типа мы можем просто присвоить значение в матрице a, так как мы знаем исходную позицию по матрице idx.Задача B(div1)/D(div2):Основная идея задачи в том, что относительный порядок элементов в четных позициях и в нечетных позициях не меняется при выполнении команд с точностью до циклического сдвига.Давайте хранить позицию для 1ого и 2ого мальчика. После 1ой операции мы сдвинем эти позиции на X или -X. Вторая операция просто поменяет позиции местами (поменяются местами все четные и нечетные позиции, но мы нам это не важно, так как по 1ому и 2ому мальчику можно все восстановить). В конце просто восстановим четные и нечетные позиции независимо и объединим ответ.Задача C(div1)Сперва решим обратную задачу: найдем минимум (максимум) от двух распределений. Воспользуемся формулами:P(a = k) = P(a <= k) — P(a <= k-1) P(max(a, b) <= k) = P(a <= k) * P(b <= k)Соответственно для минимума:P(min(a, b) >= k) = P(a >= k) * P(b >= k) = (1 — P(a <= k-1)) *(1 — P(b <= k-1))Теперь в наших формулах из условия минимум и максимум определяют систему квадратных уравнений для каждой пары P(a <= k), P(b <= k).Если решить эти уравнения, мы получим P(a<=k), P(b<=k) = (u + v ± sqrt((u + v)^2 — 4u)) / 2, где u = P(max(a,b) <= k), v = P(min(a,b) <= k). Теперь можно заметить, что если ответ существует, то мы тогда существует ответ, когда мы выберем знаки для каждой пары одинаково. (смотри комментарий)Задача D(div1)/E(div2):Существует много способов решать задачу. Один из них — SQRT-декомпозиция. Сперва сожмем все времена. Для каждого блока в декомпозиции мы будем хранить баланс для каждого элемента независимо. Ответ вычисляется просто как сумма балансов в блоках меньше того, где находится наше время плюс все балансы в текущем блоке до нашего времени для данного элемента.Другой способ — воспользоваться структурой данных описаной здесь. Для каждого элемента будем хранить два дерева — дерево времен удалений и добавлений. Тогда по порядковому номеру времени запроса в этих деревьях легко найти ответ.Задача E(div1):Построим для обеих формул граф импликаций и найдем компоненты сильной связности в графе. Если обе формулы несовместны, то ответ SIMILAR. Если только одна формула несовместна, то ответ — ответ для второй формулы.Допустим обе формулы совместны. Построим транзитивное замыкание для графов. Будем называть переменную X фиксированной в формуле F, если существует путь из -> x или (x -> ). Если есть фикированная переменная в одной формуле, но не в другой (или фиксированная, но имеет другое значение) мы можем найти ответ для второй формулы с противоположным значение этой переменной — это и будет ответом. Если мы не смогли найти эти переменные — удалим их все. В оставшемся графе нет фиксированных переменных. Найдем такое ребро u->v, которе есть в одном графе, но отсутствует в другом. Найдем решение для формулы без этого ребра, когда u = 1 и v = 0 (мы всегда можем найти решение). Это и будет ответ.Задача F(div1):Будем называть k-клику B потомком k-клики A, если B можно получить из A последовательностью следующих операций: добавить в клику вершину, связанную со всеми вершинами кликами в описании графа и выкинуть ровно одну другую вершину. Посчитаем динамику по состояниям (k-клика, разбиение ее вершин на компоненты), означающую следующее — количество остовных лесов в графе, индуцированном самой кликой и всеми ее потомками таких, что клика разделится по разным компонентам связности согласно заданному разбиению вершин (а все остальные вершины будут связаны с какой-нибудь из этих компонент). Для этого предпросчитаем все разбиения из k и k+1 элементов и переходы:1) (разбиение k+1 вершин) x (разбиение k+1 вершин) -> (разбиение k+1 вершин | null), переводящее пару разбиений — лесов в набор компонент связности их объединения, или null если появится цикл2) (разбиение k+1 вершин) x (вершина) -> (разбиение k+1 вершин | null), переводящее лес в новый лес, образованный добавлением ребра из вершины в вершину k+1 (или null, если образуется цикл)3) (разбиение k+1 вершин) -> (разбиение k вершин | null), проецирующее разбиение на первые k вершин (или null, если k+1-ая вершина образовывает отдельную компоненту)Детали реализации можно посмотреть в решении автора.",

Есть дополнительная регистрация!В этом раунде могут принять участие все те команды, которые отобрались в Раунде 1 или в Уайлд-кард раунде 1. Участников ждет соревнование по правилам классических раундов Codeforces. Одновременно с основным раундом будет проведена интернет-трансляция, которая представляет из себя обычный рейтинговый div1/div2-раунд по правилам Codeforces. В трансляции может участвовать любой участник, не зарегистрированный на основной раунд в составе отобравшейся команды.Раунд для вас подготовили AlexFetisov и winger. Это первый для нас раунд на Codeforces в качестве авторов. Огромное спасибо Глебу Евстропову (GlebsHP) за долгое сотруднечество и помощь в приготовлении раунда. Глеб делает колоссальную работу, и я хотел бы это отметить еще один раз! Также большое спасибо Kamil Debowski (Errichto), Mateusz Radecki (Radewoosh), Боре Минаеву (qwerty787788), Паше Кунявскому (PavelKunyavskiy) за прорешивание задач и дельные советы. Огромное спасибо Мише Мирзаянову (MikeMirzayanov) за все, что он сделал для всех нас!Напомним, что в Раунд 3 пройдут все те команды, которые наберут положительный балл, не меньший, чем у команды на 100-м месте. Также обращаем ваше внимание, что все команды, проходящие в Раунд 3, получат фирменную футболку Чемпионата. Помимо этого, фирменной футболкой будут награждены топ-50 участников интернет-трансляции Раунда 3.Желаем удачи и интересной борьбы!ОбновлениеРаунд завершен. Надеюсь, задачи вам понравились!

          "content": "Задача A (div2):Очевидно, что нам необходимо делать последовательность ходов вида: 1, 2, 1, 2, ...Ответ будет примерно равен 2 * n / 3. После этого у нас останется 0, 1 или 2 камня. Если у нас осталось 0 камней, то все закончилось, иначе у нас осталось либо 1, либо 2 камня и очевидно, что мы можем в этих случаях взять только 1 камень.Итоговый ответ: 2 * n / 3 + (n % 3 != 0 ? 1 : 0);Задача B (div2):Мы можем просто симулировать поведение кузнечика и отмечать все позиции, на которых он был. Очевидно, что таких различных позиций будет O(n). Если кузнечик попадет на клетку, где он уже был, то мы попали в цикл, и ответ — INFINITE. Иначе — FINITE. Задача A(div1)/C(div2):Давайте заведем 2 матрицы: a, idx. В матрице a мы будем хранить NULL для ячеек, о которых мы ничего не знаем или значение, если мы уже его определили. idx будет инициализировано как idx[i][j] = {i, j}; Затем просто просимулируем процесс для матрицы idx. Для запросов 3-его типа мы можем просто присвоить значение в матрице a, так как мы знаем исходную позицию по матрице idx.Задача B(div1)/D(div2):Основная идея задачи в том, что относительный порядок элементов в четных позициях и в нечетных позициях не меняется при выполнении команд с точностью до циклического сдвига.Давайте хранить позицию для 1ого и 2ого мальчика. После 1ой операции мы сдвинем эти позиции на X или -X. Вторая операция просто поменяет позиции местами (поменяются местами все четные и нечетные позиции, но мы нам это не важно, так как по 1ому и 2ому мальчику можно все восстановить). В конце просто восстановим четные и нечетные позиции независимо и объединим ответ.Задача C(div1)Сперва решим обратную задачу: найдем минимум (максимум) от двух распределений. Воспользуемся формулами:P(a = k) = P(a <= k) — P(a <= k-1) P(max(a, b) <= k) = P(a <= k) * P(b <= k)Соответственно для минимума:P(min(a, b) >= k) = P(a >= k) * P(b >= k) = (1 — P(a <= k-1)) *(1 — P(b <= k-1))Теперь в наших формулах из условия минимум и максимум определяют систему квадратных уравнений для каждой пары P(a <= k), P(b <= k).Если решить эти уравнения, мы получим P(a<=k), P(b<=k) = (u + v ± sqrt((u + v)^2 — 4u)) / 2, где u = P(max(a,b) <= k), v = P(min(a,b) <= k). Теперь можно заметить, что если ответ существует, то мы тогда существует ответ, когда мы выберем знаки для каждой пары одинаково. (смотри комментарий)Задача D(div1)/E(div2):Существует много способов решать задачу. Один из них — SQRT-декомпозиция. Сперва сожмем все времена. Для каждого блока в декомпозиции мы будем хранить баланс для каждого элемента независимо. Ответ вычисляется просто как сумма балансов в блоках меньше того, где находится наше время плюс все балансы в текущем блоке до нашего времени для данного элемента.Другой способ — воспользоваться структурой данных описаной здесь. Для каждого элемента будем хранить два дерева — дерево времен удалений и добавлений. Тогда по порядковому номеру времени запроса в этих деревьях легко найти ответ.Задача E(div1):Построим для обеих формул граф импликаций и найдем компоненты сильной связности в графе. Если обе формулы несовместны, то ответ SIMILAR. Если только одна формула несовместна, то ответ — ответ для второй формулы.Допустим обе формулы совместны. Построим транзитивное замыкание для графов. Будем называть переменную X фиксированной в формуле F, если существует путь из -> x или (x -> ). Если есть фикированная переменная в одной формуле, но не в другой (или фиксированная, но имеет другое значение) мы можем найти ответ для второй формулы с противоположным значение этой переменной — это и будет ответом. Если мы не смогли найти эти переменные — удалим их все. В оставшемся графе нет фиксированных переменных. Найдем такое ребро u->v, которе есть в одном графе, но отсутствует в другом. Найдем решение для формулы без этого ребра, когда u = 1 и v = 0 (мы всегда можем найти решение). Это и будет ответ.Задача F(div1):Будем называть k-клику B потомком k-клики A, если B можно получить из A последовательностью следующих операций: добавить в клику вершину, связанную со всеми вершинами кликами в описании графа и выкинуть ровно одну другую вершину. Посчитаем динамику по состояниям (k-клика, разбиение ее вершин на компоненты), означающую следующее — количество остовных лесов в графе, индуцированном самой кликой и всеми ее потомками таких, что клика разделится по разным компонентам связности согласно заданному разбиению вершин (а все остальные вершины будут связаны с какой-нибудь из этих компонент). Для этого предпросчитаем все разбиения из k и k+1 элементов и переходы:1) (разбиение k+1 вершин) x (разбиение k+1 вершин) -> (разбиение k+1 вершин | null), переводящее пару разбиений — лесов в набор компонент связности их объединения, или null если появится цикл2) (разбиение k+1 вершин) x (вершина) -> (разбиение k+1 вершин | null), переводящее лес в новый лес, образованный добавлением ребра из вершины в вершину k+1 (или null, если образуется цикл)3) (разбиение k+1 вершин) -> (разбиение k вершин | null), проецирующее разбиение на первые k вершин (или null, если k+1-ая вершина образовывает отдельную компоненту)Детали реализации можно посмотреть в решении автора.",

For i in 0..n-1 (in ascending time order), decide the type of query (add, remove, count).\n     - Keep a map \"count[x]\" that tracks how many times a value x is currently present\n       according to all queries with index < i.\n     - If we choose \"remove\", pick an x that is present (count[x] > 0).\n       Then decrement count[x].\n     - If we choose \"add\", pick an x from the chosen distribution.\n       Then increment count[x].\n     - If we choose \"count\", pick any x from the distribution (it can be absent or present).\n  3. Store queries in a vector. After generating all, shuffle them (so the input times are\n     no longer sorted). But the times themselves remain distinct and consistent so that\n     if we have a remove at time T[i], there is a matching add at some time T[j] < T[i].\n  4. Print them.\n\n  This ensures that, no matter the final shuffled order in the output, the problem's condition\n  of \"no invalid remove operations\" holds, because smaller-time adds exist for each remove.\n*/\n\nstatic const int MAX_X = 100;

          "content": "Problem A (div2):It is obvious that we need to make sequence of moves like: 1, 2, 1, 2, ...So the answer is 2 * n / 3. After that we have either 0, 1 or 2 stones left. If we have 0, we are done, otherwise we have 1 or 2 left, so we only can give 1 more stone.Final formula is: (2 * n) / 3 + (n % 3 != 0 ? 1 : 0);Problem B (div2):We can just emulate grasshopper behavior and save all positions it visits. It is obvious that we will have no more than O(n) different positions. If grasshopper appears in the same position twice that means that there is a loop and the answer is INFINITE. Otherwise the answer is FINITE. Problem A(div1)/C(div2):Let's have 2 matrices: a, idx. In a we will have NULL for cell if we don't know the value or the value. idx will be initialized with idx[i][j] = {i, j}; Then we need to emulate the process on matrix idx. If we have 3rd query we can set up the value in matrix a, because we know the original position of that cell keeping idx.Problem B(div1)/D(div2):The key in this problem is that order of all elements in odd positions and in even positions is the same. Let's say we have 2 arrays: [1, 3, 5, ...] and [2, 4, ...] (odd positions and even positions). Now if we call 2nd commands we just swap these 2 arrays, but order is the same. Obviously 1st command also keeps the order. By order I mean cyclic order (right neighbor is the same in cycle position).Let's just keep the position of 1st boy and 2nd boy. Now if we apply 1st operation we move it by X or -X. Second type of the query just swaps the positions. In the end we can construct the answer if we know positions of 1st and 2nd boys.Problem C(div1):First, let's solve inverse problem: find minimum (maximum) of two distributions. Let's use the following formulas:P(a = k) = P(a <= k) — P(a <= k-1) P(max(a, b) <= k) = P(a <= k) * P(b <= k)For minimum:P(min(a, b) >= k) = P(a >= k) * P(b >= k) = (1 — P(a <= k-1)) *(1 — P(b <= k-1))Now in our original problem minimum and maximum defines system of square equations for each pair P(a <= k), P(b <= k).Solving these equations we get P(a<=k), P(b<=k) = (u + v ± sqrt((u + v)^2 — 4u)) / 2, where u = P(max(a,b) <= k), v = P(min(a,b) <= k). Now we can notice that if there exists an answer, then there exists an answer when we chose the signs for each pair equally (check out this comment)Problem D(div1)/E(div2):There are many ways to solve this problem. One of the ways was SQRT-decomposition. First let's compress all times. Now for each block in the decomposition we will store for each element the balance in that block. So to answer the query we need to calculate sum of balances from first block to the block before the one where our element is located and then just process all requests in the current block.Another way was to use data structure from std library, described here. For each element we have two trees: remove times and add times. Then by getting order of the time in remove and add tree we can calculate the answer.Problem E(div1):Let's build for both 2-SAT formulas implication graph and let's find strong connected components in this graph. If both of the formulas are not satisfiable then the answer is SIMILAR. If only one formula is not satisfiable then we can find an answer for the second one and output it.Now, let's assume both formulas are satisfiable. Let's have a transitive closure for both of the graphs. Let's call the variable X fixed in the formula F if there is a path -> x or (x -> ). If there is a fixed variable in one formula, but not fixed in the other (or fixed but has other value) we can find the solution for that second formula with opposite value of that fixed variable — that will be an answer. If we could not find these variables, we can remove all of them. There is no fixed variables in the rest of them. Let's find an edge u->v, presented in one graph, but not presented in the other. Let's find the solution for formula without the edge with u = 1 and v = 0 (we always can find it). That is the answer.Problem F(div1):Let's define k-clique B the descendant of k-clique A, if B could be produced from A with the sequence of the following steps: add vertex to the clique, connected with all clique vertices in the graph description and remove exactly one other vertex. Let's calculate the DP with states (k-clique, separation its vertices to the components) — number of spanning forests int the graph, induced by the clique and all its descendants so that clique will be divided to different connected components according to the defined vertices separation (all of the rest vertices will be connected with some of these components). To calculate that we need to precalculate all separations from k to k+1 elements and transitions:1) (separation of k+1 vertices) x (separation k+1 vertices) -> (separation k+1 vertices | null), transform pair of separations — forests to the set of connected components of their union or null if there appears a cycle.2) (separation of k+1 vertices) x (vertex) -> (separation of k+1 vertices | null), transform forest to the new forest, generated by adding new edge from vertex to vertex k+1 (or null, if there appears a cycle)3) (separation of k+1 vertices) -> (separation of k vertices | null), projecting the separation on the first k vertices (or null, if k+1-th vertex creates a separate component)Check out details in the author solution.",

Есть дополнительная регистрация!В этом раунде могут принять участие все те команды, которые отобрались в Раунде 1 или в Уайлд-кард раунде 1. Участников ждет соревнование по правилам классических раундов Codeforces. Одновременно с основным раундом будет проведена интернет-трансляция, которая представляет из себя обычный рейтинговый div1/div2-раунд по правилам Codeforces. В трансляции может участвовать любой участник, не зарегистрированный на основной раунд в составе отобравшейся команды.Раунд для вас подготовили AlexFetisov и winger. Это первый для нас раунд на Codeforces в качестве авторов. Огромное спасибо Глебу Евстропову (GlebsHP) за долгое сотруднечество и помощь в приготовлении раунда. Глеб делает колоссальную работу, и я хотел бы это отметить еще один раз! Также большое спасибо Kamil Debowski (Errichto), Mateusz Radecki (Radewoosh), Боре Минаеву (qwerty787788), Паше Кунявскому (PavelKunyavskiy) за прорешивание задач и дельные советы. Огромное спасибо Мише Мирзаянову (MikeMirzayanov) за все, что он сделал для всех нас!Напомним, что в Раунд 3 пройдут все те команды, которые наберут положительный балл, не меньший, чем у команды на 100-м месте. Также обращаем ваше внимание, что все команды, проходящие в Раунд 3, получат фирменную футболку Чемпионата. Помимо этого, фирменной футболкой будут награждены топ-50 участников интернет-трансляции Раунда 3.Желаем удачи и интересной борьбы!ОбновлениеРаунд завершен. Надеюсь, задачи вам понравились!

          "content": "Задача A (div2):Очевидно, что нам необходимо делать последовательность ходов вида: 1, 2, 1, 2, ...Ответ будет примерно равен 2 * n / 3. После этого у нас останется 0, 1 или 2 камня. Если у нас осталось 0 камней, то все закончилось, иначе у нас осталось либо 1, либо 2 камня и очевидно, что мы можем в этих случаях взять только 1 камень.Итоговый ответ: 2 * n / 3 + (n % 3 != 0 ? 1 : 0);Задача B (div2):Мы можем просто симулировать поведение кузнечика и отмечать все позиции, на которых он был. Очевидно, что таких различных позиций будет O(n). Если кузнечик попадет на клетку, где он уже был, то мы попали в цикл, и ответ — INFINITE. Иначе — FINITE. Задача A(div1)/C(div2):Давайте заведем 2 матрицы: a, idx. В матрице a мы будем хранить NULL для ячеек, о которых мы ничего не знаем или значение, если мы уже его определили. idx будет инициализировано как idx[i][j] = {i, j}; Затем просто просимулируем процесс для матрицы idx. Для запросов 3-его типа мы можем просто присвоить значение в матрице a, так как мы знаем исходную позицию по матрице idx.Задача B(div1)/D(div2):Основная идея задачи в том, что относительный порядок элементов в четных позициях и в нечетных позициях не меняется при выполнении команд с точностью до циклического сдвига.Давайте хранить позицию для 1ого и 2ого мальчика. После 1ой операции мы сдвинем эти позиции на X или -X. Вторая операция просто поменяет позиции местами (поменяются местами все четные и нечетные позиции, но мы нам это не важно, так как по 1ому и 2ому мальчику можно все восстановить). В конце просто восстановим четные и нечетные позиции независимо и объединим ответ.Задача C(div1)Сперва решим обратную задачу: найдем минимум (максимум) от двух распределений. Воспользуемся формулами:P(a = k) = P(a <= k) — P(a <= k-1) P(max(a, b) <= k) = P(a <= k) * P(b <= k)Соответственно для минимума:P(min(a, b) >= k) = P(a >= k) * P(b >= k) = (1 — P(a <= k-1)) *(1 — P(b <= k-1))Теперь в наших формулах из условия минимум и максимум определяют систему квадратных уравнений для каждой пары P(a <= k), P(b <= k).Если решить эти уравнения, мы получим P(a<=k), P(b<=k) = (u + v ± sqrt((u + v)^2 — 4u)) / 2, где u = P(max(a,b) <= k), v = P(min(a,b) <= k). Теперь можно заметить, что если ответ существует, то мы тогда существует ответ, когда мы выберем знаки для каждой пары одинаково. (смотри комментарий)Задача D(div1)/E(div2):Существует много способов решать задачу. Один из них — SQRT-декомпозиция. Сперва сожмем все времена. Для каждого блока в декомпозиции мы будем хранить баланс для каждого элемента независимо. Ответ вычисляется просто как сумма балансов в блоках меньше того, где находится наше время плюс все балансы в текущем блоке до нашего времени для данного элемента.Другой способ — воспользоваться структурой данных описаной здесь. Для каждого элемента будем хранить два дерева — дерево времен удалений и добавлений. Тогда по порядковому номеру времени запроса в этих деревьях легко найти ответ.Задача E(div1):Построим для обеих формул граф импликаций и найдем компоненты сильной связности в графе. Если обе формулы несовместны, то ответ SIMILAR. Если только одна формула несовместна, то ответ — ответ для второй формулы.Допустим обе формулы совместны. Построим транзитивное замыкание для графов. Будем называть переменную X фиксированной в формуле F, если существует путь из -> x или (x -> ). Если есть фикированная переменная в одной формуле, но не в другой (или фиксированная, но имеет другое значение) мы можем найти ответ для второй формулы с противоположным значение этой переменной — это и будет ответом. Если мы не смогли найти эти переменные — удалим их все. В оставшемся графе нет фиксированных переменных. Найдем такое ребро u->v, которе есть в одном графе, но отсутствует в другом. Найдем решение для формулы без этого ребра, когда u = 1 и v = 0 (мы всегда можем найти решение). Это и будет ответ.Задача F(div1):Будем называть k-клику B потомком k-клики A, если B можно получить из A последовательностью следующих операций: добавить в клику вершину, связанную со всеми вершинами кликами в описании графа и выкинуть ровно одну другую вершину. Посчитаем динамику по состояниям (k-клика, разбиение ее вершин на компоненты), означающую следующее — количество остовных лесов в графе, индуцированном самой кликой и всеми ее потомками таких, что клика разделится по разным компонентам связности согласно заданному разбиению вершин (а все остальные вершины будут связаны с какой-нибудь из этих компонент). Для этого предпросчитаем все разбиения из k и k+1 элементов и переходы:1) (разбиение k+1 вершин) x (разбиение k+1 вершин) -> (разбиение k+1 вершин | null), переводящее пару разбиений — лесов в набор компонент связности их объединения, или null если появится цикл2) (разбиение k+1 вершин) x (вершина) -> (разбиение k+1 вершин | null), переводящее лес в новый лес, образованный добавлением ребра из вершины в вершину k+1 (или null, если образуется цикл)3) (разбиение k+1 вершин) -> (разбиение k вершин | null), проецирующее разбиение на первые k вершин (или null, если k+1-ая вершина образовывает отдельную компоненту)Детали реализации можно посмотреть в решении автора.",

          "content": "Hi everybody.The VK Cup Round 3 is coming (exact time).The duration will be longer than usual, likely 3 hours.As usually in VK Cup, there will be three contests — div1, div2, official one. All of them are rated. Div1 and div2 versions are for individual participants, not for teams.Setters are Radewoosh, Errichto and qwerty787788. I think that (some) problems are extremely interesting and I really wish I could participate. Thanks to GlebsHP and MikeMirzayanov, we wouldn't have a round without them. Also, thanks to AlexFetisov and winger for testing.We will later inform about the final duration. Maybe we will inform about the number of problems and scoring.I wish you great fun and no frustrating bugs. And Limak wishes you good luck!UPD The contest will last 3 hours. ADJUSTED POINTS DROP — Points will decrease with such a speed that submitting a problem at the end would give you the same number of points as in standard 2-hour rounds. I updated testers above. Top50 in the \"Div1 Edition\" contest will get t-shirts. Have I already said \"I wish I could participate\"? UPD 2There are 9 problems. Div2 gets problems 1 - 6, and Div1+R3 gets 3 - 9. It means that there are 4 shared problems.Division 2: 500 750 1000 1500 2250 3000R3 & Div1: 500 1000 1750 2250 2250 3000 3000UPD 3Enjoy the editorialUPD 4The system testing is over.

          "content": "Editorial was created by Errichto, but he said that he has enough contribution, so I'm posting it for you. ;)1 673A - Bear and Game(invented by GlebsHP — thanks!)You are supposed to implement what is described in the statement. When you read numbers ti, check if two consecutive numbers differ by more than 15 (i.e. ti - ti - 1 > 15). If yes then you should print ti - 1 + 15. You can assume that t0 = 0 and then you don't have to care about some corner case at the beginning. Also, you can assume that tn + 1 = 91 or tn + 1 = 90 (both should work — do you see why?). If your program haven't found two consecutive numbers different by more than 15 then print 90. If you still have problems to solve this problem then check codes of other participants.182866062 673B - Problems for Round(invented by Errichto)Some prefix of problems must belong to one division, and the remaining suffix must belong to the other division. Thus, we can say that we should choose the place (between two numbers) where we split problems. Each pair ai, bi (let's say that ai < bi) means that the splitting place must be between ai and bi. In other words, it must be on the right from ai and on the left from bi.For each pair if ai > bi then we swap these two numbers. Now, the splitting place must be on the right from a1, a2, ..., am, so it must be on the right from A = max(a1, a2, ..., am). In linear time you can calculate A, and similarly calculate B = min(b1, ..., bm). Then, the answer is B - A. It may turn out that A > B though but we don't want to print a negative answer. So, we should print max(0, B - A).182866333 673C - Bear and Colors(invented by Errichto)We are going to iterate over all intervals. Let's first fix the left end of the interval and denote it by i. Now, we iterate over the right end j. When we go from j to j + 1 then we get one extra ball with color cj + 1. In one global array cnt[n] we can keep the number of occurrences of each color (we can clear the array for each new i). We should increase by one cnt[cj + 1] and then check whether cj + 1 becomes a new dominant color. But how to do it?Additionally, let's keep one variable best with the current dominant color. When we go to j + 1 then we should whether cnt[cj + 1] > cnt[best] or (cnt[cj + 1] =  = cnt[best] and cj + 1 < best). The second condition checks which color has smaller index (in case of a tie). And we must increase answer[best] by one then because we know that best is dominant for the current interval. At the end, print values answer[1], answer[2], ..., answer[n].182866634 673D - Bear and Two Paths(invented by Errichto)There is no solution if n = 4 or k ≤ n. But for n ≥ 5 and k ≥ n + 1 you can construct the following graph:Here, cities (x1, x2, ..., xn - 4) denote other cities in any order you choose (cities different than a, b, c, d). You should print (a, c, x1, x2, ..., xn - 4, d, b) in the first line, and (c, a, x1, x2, ..., xn - 4, b, d) in the second line.Two not very hard challenges for you. Are you able to prove that the answer doesn't exist for k = n? Can you solve the problem if the four given cities don't have to be distinct but it's guaranteed that a ≠ b and c ≠ d?182866835 673E - Levels and Regions(invented by Radewoosh)When we repeat something and each time we have probability p to succeed then the expected number or tries is , till we succeed. How to calculate the expected time for one region [low, high]? For each i in some moment we will try to beat this level and then there will be S = tlow + tlow + 1 + ... + ti tokens in the bag, including ti tokens allowing us to beat this new level. The probability to succeed is , so the expected time is . So, in total we should sum up values for i < j. Ok, we managed to understand the actual problem. You can now stop and try to find a slow solution in O(n2·k). Hint: use the dynamic programming. Let dp[i][j] denote the optimal result for prefix of i levels, if we divide them into j regions. Let pre[i] denote the result for region containing levels 1, 2, ..., i (think how to calculate it easily with one loop). Let sum[i] denote the sum of tj for all 1 ≤ j ≤ i. Let rev[i] denote the sum of for all 1 ≤ j ≤ i. Now let's write formula for dp[i][j], as the minimum over l denoting the end of the previous region: So we can use convex hull trick to calculate it in O(n·k). You should also get AC with a bit slower divide&conquer trick, if it's implemented carefully.182866966 673F - Bearish Fanpages(invented by Radewoosh)Let's say that every company has one parent (a company it follows). Also, every copmany has some (maybe empty) set of children. It's crucial that sets of children are disjoint.For each company let's keep (and always update) one value, equal to the sum of: the income from its own fanpage the income from its children's fanpages It turns out that after each query only the above sum changes only for a few values. If a starts to follows b then you should care about a, b, par[a], par[b], par[par[a]]. And maybe par[par[b]] and par[par[par[a]]] if you want to be sure. You can stop reading now for a moment and analyze that indeed other companies will keep the same sum, described above.Ok, but so far we don't count the income coming from parent's fanpage. But, for each company we can store all its children in one set. All children have the same \"income from parent's fanpage\" because they have the same parent. So, in set you can keep children sorted by the sum described above. Then, we should always puts the extreme elements from sets in one global set. In the global set you care about the total income, equal to the sum described above and this new \"income from parent\". Check codes for details. The complexity should be , with big constant factor.182867477 674E - Bear and Destroying Subtrees(invented by Errichto)Let dp[v][h] denote the probability that subtree v (if attacked now) would have height at most h. The first observation is that we don't care about big h because it's very unlikely that a path with e.g. 100 edges will survive. Let's later talk about choosing h and now let's say that it's enough to consider h up to 60.When we should answer a query for subtree v then we should sum up h·(dp[v][h] - dp[v][h - 1]) to get the answer. The other query is harder.Let's say that a new vertex is attached to vertex v. Then, among dp[v][0], dp[v][1], dp[v][2], ... only dp[v][0] changes (other values stay the same). Also, one value dp[par[v]][1] changes, and so does dp[par[par[v]]][2] and so on. You should iterate over MAX_H vertices (each time going to parent) and update the corresponding value. TODO — puts here come formula for updating value.The complexity is O(q·MAX_H). You may think that MAX_H = 30 is enough because is small enough. Unfortunately, there exist malicious tests. Consider a tree with paths from root, each with length 31. Now, we talk about the probability of magnitude: 1 - (1 - (1 / 2)d)N / dwhich is more than 10 - 6 for d = 30.http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1+-+(1-(1%2F2)%5Ed)%5E(N%2Fd)+for+N+%3D+500000+and+d+%3D+30182867218 674F - Bears and Juice(invented by Radewoosh)Let's start with O(q·p2) approach, with the dynamic programming. Let dp[days][beds] denote the maximum number of barrels to win if there are days days left and beds places to sleep left. Then: Here, i represents the number of bears who will go to sleep. If the same i bears drink from the same X barrels and this exact set of bears go to sleep then on the next day we only have X barrels to consider (wine is in one of them). And for X = dp[days - 1][beds - i] we will manage to find the wine then.And how to compute the dp faster? Organizers have ugly solution with something similar to meet in the middle. We calculate dp for first q2 / 3 days and later we use multiply vectors by matrix, to get further answers faster. The complexity is equivalent to O(p·q) but only because roughly q = p3. We saw shortest codes though. How to do it guys?You may wonder why there was 232 instead of 109 + 7. It was to fight with making the brute force faster. For 109 + 7 you could add sum +  = dp[a][b]·dp[c][d] about 15 times (using unsigned long long's) and only then compute modulo. You would then get very fast solution.182867669 674G - Choosing Ads(invented by qwerty787788)Let's first consider a solution processing query in O(n) time, but using O(1) extra memory. If p = 51%, it's a well known problem. We should store one element and some balance. When processing next element, if it's equal to our, we increase balance. If it's not equal, and balance is positive, we decrease it. If it is zero, we getting new element as stored, and setting balance to 1.To generalize to case of elements, which are at least 100/k%, we will do next. Let's store k elements with balance for each. When getting a new element, if it's in set of our 5, we will add 1 to it's balance. If we have less, than 5 elements, just add new element with balance 1. Else, if there is element with balance 0, replace it by new element with balance one. Else, subtract 1 from each balance. The meaning of such balance becomes more mysterious, but it's not hard to check, that value is at least 100/k% of all elements, it's balance will be positive.To generalize even more, we can join two of such balanced set. To do that, we sum balances of elements of all sets, than join sets to one, and then removing elements with smallest balance one, by one, untill there is k elements in set. To remove element, we should subtract it's balance from all other balances.And now, we can merge this sets on segment, using segment tree. This solution will have complexity like n * log(n) * MERGE, where MERGE is time of merging two structures. Probably, when k is 5, k2 / 2 is fastest way. But the profit is we don't need complex structures to check which elements are really in top, so solution works much faster.",

All of them are rated. Div1 and div2 versions are for individual participants, not for teams.Setters are Radewoosh, Errichto and qwerty787788. I think that (some) problems are extremely interesting and I really wish I could participate. Thanks to GlebsHP and MikeMirzayanov, we wouldn't have a round without them. Also, thanks to AlexFetisov and winger for testing.We will later inform about the final duration. Maybe we will inform about the number of problems and scoring.I wish you great fun and no frustrating bugs. And Limak wishes you good luck!UPD The contest will last 3 hours. ADJUSTED POINTS DROP — Points will decrease with such a speed that submitting a problem at the end would give you the same number of points as in standard 2-hour rounds. I updated testers above. Top50 in the \"Div1 Edition\" contest will get t-shirts. Have I already said \"I wish I could participate\"? UPD 2There are 9 problems. Div2 gets problems 1 - 6, and Div1+R3 gets 3 - 9. It means that there are 4 shared problems.Division 2: 500 750 1000 1500 2250 3000R3 & Div1: 500 1000 1750 2250 2250 3000 3000UPD 3Enjoy the editorialUPD 4The system testing is over.

          "content": "Editorial was created by Errichto, but he said that he has enough contribution, so I'm posting it for you. ;)1 673A - Bear and Game(invented by GlebsHP — thanks!)You are supposed to implement what is described in the statement. When you read numbers ti, check if two consecutive numbers differ by more than 15 (i.e. ti - ti - 1 > 15). If yes then you should print ti - 1 + 15. You can assume that t0 = 0 and then you don't have to care about some corner case at the beginning. Also, you can assume that tn + 1 = 91 or tn + 1 = 90 (both should work — do you see why?). If your program haven't found two consecutive numbers different by more than 15 then print 90. If you still have problems to solve this problem then check codes of other participants.182866062 673B - Problems for Round(invented by Errichto)Some prefix of problems must belong to one division, and the remaining suffix must belong to the other division. Thus, we can say that we should choose the place (between two numbers) where we split problems. Each pair ai, bi (let's say that ai < bi) means that the splitting place must be between ai and bi. In other words, it must be on the right from ai and on the left from bi.For each pair if ai > bi then we swap these two numbers. Now, the splitting place must be on the right from a1, a2, ..., am, so it must be on the right from A = max(a1, a2, ..., am). In linear time you can calculate A, and similarly calculate B = min(b1, ..., bm). Then, the answer is B - A. It may turn out that A > B though but we don't want to print a negative answer. So, we should print max(0, B - A).182866333 673C - Bear and Colors(invented by Errichto)We are going to iterate over all intervals. Let's first fix the left end of the interval and denote it by i. Now, we iterate over the right end j. When we go from j to j + 1 then we get one extra ball with color cj + 1. In one global array cnt[n] we can keep the number of occurrences of each color (we can clear the array for each new i). We should increase by one cnt[cj + 1] and then check whether cj + 1 becomes a new dominant color. But how to do it?Additionally, let's keep one variable best with the current dominant color. When we go to j + 1 then we should whether cnt[cj + 1] > cnt[best] or (cnt[cj + 1] =  = cnt[best] and cj + 1 < best). The second condition checks which color has smaller index (in case of a tie). And we must increase answer[best] by one then because we know that best is dominant for the current interval. At the end, print values answer[1], answer[2], ..., answer[n].182866634 673D - Bear and Two Paths(invented by Errichto)There is no solution if n = 4 or k ≤ n. But for n ≥ 5 and k ≥ n + 1 you can construct the following graph:Here, cities (x1, x2, ..., xn - 4) denote other cities in any order you choose (cities different than a, b, c, d). You should print (a, c, x1, x2, ..., xn - 4, d, b) in the first line, and (c, a, x1, x2, ..., xn - 4, b, d) in the second line.Two not very hard challenges for you. Are you able to prove that the answer doesn't exist for k = n? Can you solve the problem if the four given cities don't have to be distinct but it's guaranteed that a ≠ b and c ≠ d?182866835 673E - Levels and Regions(invented by Radewoosh)When we repeat something and each time we have probability p to succeed then the expected number or tries is , till we succeed. How to calculate the expected time for one region [low, high]? For each i in some moment we will try to beat this level and then there will be S = tlow + tlow + 1 + ... + ti tokens in the bag, including ti tokens allowing us to beat this new level. The probability to succeed is , so the expected time is . So, in total we should sum up values for i < j. Ok, we managed to understand the actual problem. You can now stop and try to find a slow solution in O(n2·k). Hint: use the dynamic programming. Let dp[i][j] denote the optimal result for prefix of i levels, if we divide them into j regions. Let pre[i] denote the result for region containing levels 1, 2, ..., i (think how to calculate it easily with one loop). Let sum[i] denote the sum of tj for all 1 ≤ j ≤ i. Let rev[i] denote the sum of for all 1 ≤ j ≤ i. Now let's write formula for dp[i][j], as the minimum over l denoting the end of the previous region: So we can use convex hull trick to calculate it in O(n·k). You should also get AC with a bit slower divide&conquer trick, if it's implemented carefully.182866966 673F - Bearish Fanpages(invented by Radewoosh)Let's say that every company has one parent (a company it follows). Also, every copmany has some (maybe empty) set of children. It's crucial that sets of children are disjoint.For each company let's keep (and always update) one value, equal to the sum of: the income from its own fanpage the income from its children's fanpages It turns out that after each query only the above sum changes only for a few values. If a starts to follows b then you should care about a, b, par[a], par[b], par[par[a]]. And maybe par[par[b]] and par[par[par[a]]] if you want to be sure. You can stop reading now for a moment and analyze that indeed other companies will keep the same sum, described above.Ok, but so far we don't count the income coming from parent's fanpage. But, for each company we can store all its children in one set. All children have the same \"income from parent's fanpage\" because they have the same parent. So, in set you can keep children sorted by the sum described above. Then, we should always puts the extreme elements from sets in one global set. In the global set you care about the total income, equal to the sum described above and this new \"income from parent\". Check codes for details. The complexity should be , with big constant factor.182867477 674E - Bear and Destroying Subtrees(invented by Errichto)Let dp[v][h] denote the probability that subtree v (if attacked now) would have height at most h. The first observation is that we don't care about big h because it's very unlikely that a path with e.g. 100 edges will survive. Let's later talk about choosing h and now let's say that it's enough to consider h up to 60.When we should answer a query for subtree v then we should sum up h·(dp[v][h] - dp[v][h - 1]) to get the answer. The other query is harder.Let's say that a new vertex is attached to vertex v. Then, among dp[v][0], dp[v][1], dp[v][2], ... only dp[v][0] changes (other values stay the same). Also, one value dp[par[v]][1] changes, and so does dp[par[par[v]]][2] and so on. You should iterate over MAX_H vertices (each time going to parent) and update the corresponding value. TODO — puts here come formula for updating value.The complexity is O(q·MAX_H). You may think that MAX_H = 30 is enough because is small enough. Unfortunately, there exist malicious tests. Consider a tree with paths from root, each with length 31. Now, we talk about the probability of magnitude: 1 - (1 - (1 / 2)d)N / dwhich is more than 10 - 6 for d = 30.http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1+-+(1-(1%2F2)%5Ed)%5E(N%2Fd)+for+N+%3D+500000+and+d+%3D+30182867218 674F - Bears and Juice(invented by Radewoosh)Let's start with O(q·p2) approach, with the dynamic programming. Let dp[days][beds] denote the maximum number of barrels to win if there are days days left and beds places to sleep left. Then: Here, i represents the number of bears who will go to sleep. If the same i bears drink from the same X barrels and this exact set of bears go to sleep then on the next day we only have X barrels to consider (wine is in one of them). And for X = dp[days - 1][beds - i] we will manage to find the wine then.And how to compute the dp faster? Organizers have ugly solution with something similar to meet in the middle. We calculate dp for first q2 / 3 days and later we use multiply vectors by matrix, to get further answers faster. The complexity is equivalent to O(p·q) but only because roughly q = p3. We saw shortest codes though. How to do it guys?You may wonder why there was 232 instead of 109 + 7. It was to fight with making the brute force faster. For 109 + 7 you could add sum +  = dp[a][b]·dp[c][d] about 15 times (using unsigned long long's) and only then compute modulo. You would then get very fast solution.182867669 674G - Choosing Ads(invented by qwerty787788)Let's first consider a solution processing query in O(n) time, but using O(1) extra memory. If p = 51%, it's a well known problem. We should store one element and some balance. When processing next element, if it's equal to our, we increase balance. If it's not equal, and balance is positive, we decrease it. If it is zero, we getting new element as stored, and setting balance to 1.To generalize to case of elements, which are at least 100/k%, we will do next. Let's store k elements with balance for each. When getting a new element, if it's in set of our 5, we will add 1 to it's balance. If we have less, than 5 elements, just add new element with balance 1. Else, if there is element with balance 0, replace it by new element with balance one. Else, subtract 1 from each balance. The meaning of such balance becomes more mysterious, but it's not hard to check, that value is at least 100/k% of all elements, it's balance will be positive.To generalize even more, we can join two of such balanced set. To do that, we sum balances of elements of all sets, than join sets to one, and then removing elements with smallest balance one, by one, untill there is k elements in set. To remove element, we should subtract it's balance from all other balances.And now, we can merge this sets on segment, using segment tree. This solution will have complexity like n * log(n) * MERGE, where MERGE is time of merging two structures. Probably, when k is 5, k2 / 2 is fastest way. But the profit is we don't need complex structures to check which elements are really in top, so solution works much faster.",

          "content": "Hi everybody.The VK Cup Round 3 is coming (exact time).The duration will be longer than usual, likely 3 hours.As usually in VK Cup, there will be three contests — div1, div2, official one. All of them are rated. Div1 and div2 versions are for individual participants, not for teams.Setters are Radewoosh, Errichto and qwerty787788. I think that (some) problems are extremely interesting and I really wish I could participate. Thanks to GlebsHP and MikeMirzayanov, we wouldn't have a round without them. Also, thanks to AlexFetisov and winger for testing.We will later inform about the final duration. Maybe we will inform about the number of problems and scoring.I wish you great fun and no frustrating bugs. And Limak wishes you good luck!UPD The contest will last 3 hours. ADJUSTED POINTS DROP — Points will decrease with such a speed that submitting a problem at the end would give you the same number of points as in standard 2-hour rounds. I updated testers above. Top50 in the \"Div1 Edition\" contest will get t-shirts. Have I already said \"I wish I could participate\"? UPD 2There are 9 problems. Div2 gets problems 1 - 6, and Div1+R3 gets 3 - 9. It means that there are 4 shared problems.Division 2: 500 750 1000 1500 2250 3000R3 & Div1: 500 1000 1750 2250 2250 3000 3000UPD 3Enjoy the editorialUPD 4The system testing is over.

          "content": "Editorial was created by Errichto, but he said that he has enough contribution, so I'm posting it for you. ;)1 673A - Bear and Game(invented by GlebsHP — thanks!)You are supposed to implement what is described in the statement. When you read numbers ti, check if two consecutive numbers differ by more than 15 (i.e. ti - ti - 1 > 15). If yes then you should print ti - 1 + 15. You can assume that t0 = 0 and then you don't have to care about some corner case at the beginning. Also, you can assume that tn + 1 = 91 or tn + 1 = 90 (both should work — do you see why?). If your program haven't found two consecutive numbers different by more than 15 then print 90. If you still have problems to solve this problem then check codes of other participants.182866062 673B - Problems for Round(invented by Errichto)Some prefix of problems must belong to one division, and the remaining suffix must belong to the other division. Thus, we can say that we should choose the place (between two numbers) where we split problems. Each pair ai, bi (let's say that ai < bi) means that the splitting place must be between ai and bi. In other words, it must be on the right from ai and on the left from bi.For each pair if ai > bi then we swap these two numbers. Now, the splitting place must be on the right from a1, a2, ..., am, so it must be on the right from A = max(a1, a2, ..., am). In linear time you can calculate A, and similarly calculate B = min(b1, ..., bm). Then, the answer is B - A. It may turn out that A > B though but we don't want to print a negative answer. So, we should print max(0, B - A).182866333 673C - Bear and Colors(invented by Errichto)We are going to iterate over all intervals. Let's first fix the left end of the interval and denote it by i. Now, we iterate over the right end j. When we go from j to j + 1 then we get one extra ball with color cj + 1. In one global array cnt[n] we can keep the number of occurrences of each color (we can clear the array for each new i). We should increase by one cnt[cj + 1] and then check whether cj + 1 becomes a new dominant color. But how to do it?Additionally, let's keep one variable best with the current dominant color. When we go to j + 1 then we should whether cnt[cj + 1] > cnt[best] or (cnt[cj + 1] =  = cnt[best] and cj + 1 < best). The second condition checks which color has smaller index (in case of a tie). And we must increase answer[best] by one then because we know that best is dominant for the current interval. At the end, print values answer[1], answer[2], ..., answer[n].182866634 673D - Bear and Two Paths(invented by Errichto)There is no solution if n = 4 or k ≤ n. But for n ≥ 5 and k ≥ n + 1 you can construct the following graph:Here, cities (x1, x2, ..., xn - 4) denote other cities in any order you choose (cities different than a, b, c, d). You should print (a, c, x1, x2, ..., xn - 4, d, b) in the first line, and (c, a, x1, x2, ..., xn - 4, b, d) in the second line.Two not very hard challenges for you. Are you able to prove that the answer doesn't exist for k = n? Can you solve the problem if the four given cities don't have to be distinct but it's guaranteed that a ≠ b and c ≠ d?182866835 673E - Levels and Regions(invented by Radewoosh)When we repeat something and each time we have probability p to succeed then the expected number or tries is , till we succeed. How to calculate the expected time for one region [low, high]? For each i in some moment we will try to beat this level and then there will be S = tlow + tlow + 1 + ... + ti tokens in the bag, including ti tokens allowing us to beat this new level. The probability to succeed is , so the expected time is . So, in total we should sum up values for i < j. Ok, we managed to understand the actual problem. You can now stop and try to find a slow solution in O(n2·k). Hint: use the dynamic programming. Let dp[i][j] denote the optimal result for prefix of i levels, if we divide them into j regions. Let pre[i] denote the result for region containing levels 1, 2, ..., i (think how to calculate it easily with one loop). Let sum[i] denote the sum of tj for all 1 ≤ j ≤ i. Let rev[i] denote the sum of for all 1 ≤ j ≤ i. Now let's write formula for dp[i][j], as the minimum over l denoting the end of the previous region: So we can use convex hull trick to calculate it in O(n·k). You should also get AC with a bit slower divide&conquer trick, if it's implemented carefully.182866966 673F - Bearish Fanpages(invented by Radewoosh)Let's say that every company has one parent (a company it follows). Also, every copmany has some (maybe empty) set of children. It's crucial that sets of children are disjoint.For each company let's keep (and always update) one value, equal to the sum of: the income from its own fanpage the income from its children's fanpages It turns out that after each query only the above sum changes only for a few values. If a starts to follows b then you should care about a, b, par[a], par[b], par[par[a]]. And maybe par[par[b]] and par[par[par[a]]] if you want to be sure. You can stop reading now for a moment and analyze that indeed other companies will keep the same sum, described above.Ok, but so far we don't count the income coming from parent's fanpage. But, for each company we can store all its children in one set. All children have the same \"income from parent's fanpage\" because they have the same parent. So, in set you can keep children sorted by the sum described above. Then, we should always puts the extreme elements from sets in one global set. In the global set you care about the total income, equal to the sum described above and this new \"income from parent\". Check codes for details. The complexity should be , with big constant factor.182867477 674E - Bear and Destroying Subtrees(invented by Errichto)Let dp[v][h] denote the probability that subtree v (if attacked now) would have height at most h. The first observation is that we don't care about big h because it's very unlikely that a path with e.g. 100 edges will survive. Let's later talk about choosing h and now let's say that it's enough to consider h up to 60.When we should answer a query for subtree v then we should sum up h·(dp[v][h] - dp[v][h - 1]) to get the answer. The other query is harder.Let's say that a new vertex is attached to vertex v. Then, among dp[v][0], dp[v][1], dp[v][2], ... only dp[v][0] changes (other values stay the same). Also, one value dp[par[v]][1] changes, and so does dp[par[par[v]]][2] and so on. You should iterate over MAX_H vertices (each time going to parent) and update the corresponding value. TODO — puts here come formula for updating value.The complexity is O(q·MAX_H). You may think that MAX_H = 30 is enough because is small enough. Unfortunately, there exist malicious tests. Consider a tree with paths from root, each with length 31. Now, we talk about the probability of magnitude: 1 - (1 - (1 / 2)d)N / dwhich is more than 10 - 6 for d = 30.http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1+-+(1-(1%2F2)%5Ed)%5E(N%2Fd)+for+N+%3D+500000+and+d+%3D+30182867218 674F - Bears and Juice(invented by Radewoosh)Let's start with O(q·p2) approach, with the dynamic programming. Let dp[days][beds] denote the maximum number of barrels to win if there are days days left and beds places to sleep left. Then: Here, i represents the number of bears who will go to sleep. If the same i bears drink from the same X barrels and this exact set of bears go to sleep then on the next day we only have X barrels to consider (wine is in one of them). And for X = dp[days - 1][beds - i] we will manage to find the wine then.And how to compute the dp faster? Organizers have ugly solution with something similar to meet in the middle. We calculate dp for first q2 / 3 days and later we use multiply vectors by matrix, to get further answers faster. The complexity is equivalent to O(p·q) but only because roughly q = p3. We saw shortest codes though. How to do it guys?You may wonder why there was 232 instead of 109 + 7. It was to fight with making the brute force faster. For 109 + 7 you could add sum +  = dp[a][b]·dp[c][d] about 15 times (using unsigned long long's) and only then compute modulo. You would then get very fast solution.182867669 674G - Choosing Ads(invented by qwerty787788)Let's first consider a solution processing query in O(n) time, but using O(1) extra memory. If p = 51%, it's a well known problem. We should store one element and some balance. When processing next element, if it's equal to our, we increase balance. If it's not equal, and balance is positive, we decrease it. If it is zero, we getting new element as stored, and setting balance to 1.To generalize to case of elements, which are at least 100/k%, we will do next. Let's store k elements with balance for each. When getting a new element, if it's in set of our 5, we will add 1 to it's balance. If we have less, than 5 elements, just add new element with balance 1. Else, if there is element with balance 0, replace it by new element with balance one. Else, subtract 1 from each balance. The meaning of such balance becomes more mysterious, but it's not hard to check, that value is at least 100/k% of all elements, it's balance will be positive.To generalize even more, we can join two of such balanced set. To do that, we sum balances of elements of all sets, than join sets to one, and then removing elements with smallest balance one, by one, untill there is k elements in set. To remove element, we should subtract it's balance from all other balances.And now, we can merge this sets on segment, using segment tree. This solution will have complexity like n * log(n) * MERGE, where MERGE is time of merging two structures. Probably, when k is 5, k2 / 2 is fastest way. But the profit is we don't need complex structures to check which elements are really in top, so solution works much faster.",

All of them are rated. Div1 and div2 versions are for individual participants, not for teams.Setters are Radewoosh, Errichto and qwerty787788. I think that (some) problems are extremely interesting and I really wish I could participate. Thanks to GlebsHP and MikeMirzayanov, we wouldn't have a round without them. Also, thanks to AlexFetisov and winger for testing.We will later inform about the final duration. Maybe we will inform about the number of problems and scoring.I wish you great fun and no frustrating bugs. And Limak wishes you good luck!UPD The contest will last 3 hours. ADJUSTED POINTS DROP — Points will decrease with such a speed that submitting a problem at the end would give you the same number of points as in standard 2-hour rounds. I updated testers above. Top50 in the \"Div1 Edition\" contest will get t-shirts. Have I already said \"I wish I could participate\"? UPD 2There are 9 problems. Div2 gets problems 1 - 6, and Div1+R3 gets 3 - 9. It means that there are 4 shared problems.Division 2: 500 750 1000 1500 2250 3000R3 & Div1: 500 1000 1750 2250 2250 3000 3000UPD 3Enjoy the editorialUPD 4The system testing is over.

          "content": "Editorial was created by Errichto, but he said that he has enough contribution, so I'm posting it for you. ;)1 673A - Bear and Game(invented by GlebsHP — thanks!)You are supposed to implement what is described in the statement. When you read numbers ti, check if two consecutive numbers differ by more than 15 (i.e. ti - ti - 1 > 15). If yes then you should print ti - 1 + 15. You can assume that t0 = 0 and then you don't have to care about some corner case at the beginning. Also, you can assume that tn + 1 = 91 or tn + 1 = 90 (both should work — do you see why?). If your program haven't found two consecutive numbers different by more than 15 then print 90. If you still have problems to solve this problem then check codes of other participants.182866062 673B - Problems for Round(invented by Errichto)Some prefix of problems must belong to one division, and the remaining suffix must belong to the other division. Thus, we can say that we should choose the place (between two numbers) where we split problems. Each pair ai, bi (let's say that ai < bi) means that the splitting place must be between ai and bi. In other words, it must be on the right from ai and on the left from bi.For each pair if ai > bi then we swap these two numbers. Now, the splitting place must be on the right from a1, a2, ..., am, so it must be on the right from A = max(a1, a2, ..., am). In linear time you can calculate A, and similarly calculate B = min(b1, ..., bm). Then, the answer is B - A. It may turn out that A > B though but we don't want to print a negative answer. So, we should print max(0, B - A).182866333 673C - Bear and Colors(invented by Errichto)We are going to iterate over all intervals. Let's first fix the left end of the interval and denote it by i. Now, we iterate over the right end j. When we go from j to j + 1 then we get one extra ball with color cj + 1. In one global array cnt[n] we can keep the number of occurrences of each color (we can clear the array for each new i). We should increase by one cnt[cj + 1] and then check whether cj + 1 becomes a new dominant color. But how to do it?Additionally, let's keep one variable best with the current dominant color. When we go to j + 1 then we should whether cnt[cj + 1] > cnt[best] or (cnt[cj + 1] =  = cnt[best] and cj + 1 < best). The second condition checks which color has smaller index (in case of a tie). And we must increase answer[best] by one then because we know that best is dominant for the current interval. At the end, print values answer[1], answer[2], ..., answer[n].182866634 673D - Bear and Two Paths(invented by Errichto)There is no solution if n = 4 or k ≤ n. But for n ≥ 5 and k ≥ n + 1 you can construct the following graph:Here, cities (x1, x2, ..., xn - 4) denote other cities in any order you choose (cities different than a, b, c, d). You should print (a, c, x1, x2, ..., xn - 4, d, b) in the first line, and (c, a, x1, x2, ..., xn - 4, b, d) in the second line.Two not very hard challenges for you. Are you able to prove that the answer doesn't exist for k = n? Can you solve the problem if the four given cities don't have to be distinct but it's guaranteed that a ≠ b and c ≠ d?182866835 673E - Levels and Regions(invented by Radewoosh)When we repeat something and each time we have probability p to succeed then the expected number or tries is , till we succeed. How to calculate the expected time for one region [low, high]? For each i in some moment we will try to beat this level and then there will be S = tlow + tlow + 1 + ... + ti tokens in the bag, including ti tokens allowing us to beat this new level. The probability to succeed is , so the expected time is . So, in total we should sum up values for i < j. Ok, we managed to understand the actual problem. You can now stop and try to find a slow solution in O(n2·k). Hint: use the dynamic programming. Let dp[i][j] denote the optimal result for prefix of i levels, if we divide them into j regions. Let pre[i] denote the result for region containing levels 1, 2, ..., i (think how to calculate it easily with one loop). Let sum[i] denote the sum of tj for all 1 ≤ j ≤ i. Let rev[i] denote the sum of for all 1 ≤ j ≤ i. Now let's write formula for dp[i][j], as the minimum over l denoting the end of the previous region: So we can use convex hull trick to calculate it in O(n·k). You should also get AC with a bit slower divide&conquer trick, if it's implemented carefully.182866966 673F - Bearish Fanpages(invented by Radewoosh)Let's say that every company has one parent (a company it follows). Also, every copmany has some (maybe empty) set of children. It's crucial that sets of children are disjoint.For each company let's keep (and always update) one value, equal to the sum of: the income from its own fanpage the income from its children's fanpages It turns out that after each query only the above sum changes only for a few values. If a starts to follows b then you should care about a, b, par[a], par[b], par[par[a]]. And maybe par[par[b]] and par[par[par[a]]] if you want to be sure. You can stop reading now for a moment and analyze that indeed other companies will keep the same sum, described above.Ok, but so far we don't count the income coming from parent's fanpage. But, for each company we can store all its children in one set. All children have the same \"income from parent's fanpage\" because they have the same parent. So, in set you can keep children sorted by the sum described above. Then, we should always puts the extreme elements from sets in one global set. In the global set you care about the total income, equal to the sum described above and this new \"income from parent\". Check codes for details. The complexity should be , with big constant factor.182867477 674E - Bear and Destroying Subtrees(invented by Errichto)Let dp[v][h] denote the probability that subtree v (if attacked now) would have height at most h. The first observation is that we don't care about big h because it's very unlikely that a path with e.g. 100 edges will survive. Let's later talk about choosing h and now let's say that it's enough to consider h up to 60.When we should answer a query for subtree v then we should sum up h·(dp[v][h] - dp[v][h - 1]) to get the answer. The other query is harder.Let's say that a new vertex is attached to vertex v. Then, among dp[v][0], dp[v][1], dp[v][2], ... only dp[v][0] changes (other values stay the same). Also, one value dp[par[v]][1] changes, and so does dp[par[par[v]]][2] and so on. You should iterate over MAX_H vertices (each time going to parent) and update the corresponding value. TODO — puts here come formula for updating value.The complexity is O(q·MAX_H). You may think that MAX_H = 30 is enough because is small enough. Unfortunately, there exist malicious tests. Consider a tree with paths from root, each with length 31. Now, we talk about the probability of magnitude: 1 - (1 - (1 / 2)d)N / dwhich is more than 10 - 6 for d = 30.http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1+-+(1-(1%2F2)%5Ed)%5E(N%2Fd)+for+N+%3D+500000+and+d+%3D+30182867218 674F - Bears and Juice(invented by Radewoosh)Let's start with O(q·p2) approach, with the dynamic programming. Let dp[days][beds] denote the maximum number of barrels to win if there are days days left and beds places to sleep left. Then: Here, i represents the number of bears who will go to sleep. If the same i bears drink from the same X barrels and this exact set of bears go to sleep then on the next day we only have X barrels to consider (wine is in one of them). And for X = dp[days - 1][beds - i] we will manage to find the wine then.And how to compute the dp faster? Organizers have ugly solution with something similar to meet in the middle. We calculate dp for first q2 / 3 days and later we use multiply vectors by matrix, to get further answers faster. The complexity is equivalent to O(p·q) but only because roughly q = p3. We saw shortest codes though. How to do it guys?You may wonder why there was 232 instead of 109 + 7. It was to fight with making the brute force faster. For 109 + 7 you could add sum +  = dp[a][b]·dp[c][d] about 15 times (using unsigned long long's) and only then compute modulo. You would then get very fast solution.182867669 674G - Choosing Ads(invented by qwerty787788)Let's first consider a solution processing query in O(n) time, but using O(1) extra memory. If p = 51%, it's a well known problem. We should store one element and some balance. When processing next element, if it's equal to our, we increase balance. If it's not equal, and balance is positive, we decrease it. If it is zero, we getting new element as stored, and setting balance to 1.To generalize to case of elements, which are at least 100/k%, we will do next. Let's store k elements with balance for each. When getting a new element, if it's in set of our 5, we will add 1 to it's balance. If we have less, than 5 elements, just add new element with balance 1. Else, if there is element with balance 0, replace it by new element with balance one. Else, subtract 1 from each balance. The meaning of such balance becomes more mysterious, but it's not hard to check, that value is at least 100/k% of all elements, it's balance will be positive.To generalize even more, we can join two of such balanced set. To do that, we sum balances of elements of all sets, than join sets to one, and then removing elements with smallest balance one, by one, untill there is k elements in set. To remove element, we should subtract it's balance from all other balances.And now, we can merge this sets on segment, using segment tree. This solution will have complexity like n * log(n) * MERGE, where MERGE is time of merging two structures. Probably, when k is 5, k2 / 2 is fastest way. But the profit is we don't need complex structures to check which elements are really in top, so solution works much faster.",

All of them are rated. Div1 and div2 versions are for individual participants, not for teams.Setters are Radewoosh, Errichto and qwerty787788. I think that (some) problems are extremely interesting and I really wish I could participate. Thanks to GlebsHP and MikeMirzayanov, we wouldn't have a round without them. Also, thanks to AlexFetisov and winger for testing.We will later inform about the final duration. Maybe we will inform about the number of problems and scoring.I wish you great fun and no frustrating bugs. And Limak wishes you good luck!UPD The contest will last 3 hours. ADJUSTED POINTS DROP — Points will decrease with such a speed that submitting a problem at the end would give you the same number of points as in standard 2-hour rounds. I updated testers above. Top50 in the \"Div1 Edition\" contest will get t-shirts. Have I already said \"I wish I could participate\"? UPD 2There are 9 problems. Div2 gets problems 1 - 6, and Div1+R3 gets 3 - 9. It means that there are 4 shared problems.Division 2: 500 750 1000 1500 2250 3000R3 & Div1: 500 1000 1750 2250 2250 3000 3000UPD 3Enjoy the editorialUPD 4The system testing is over.

          "content": "Editorial was created by Errichto, but he said that he has enough contribution, so I'm posting it for you. ;)1 673A - Bear and Game(invented by GlebsHP — thanks!)You are supposed to implement what is described in the statement. When you read numbers ti, check if two consecutive numbers differ by more than 15 (i.e. ti - ti - 1 > 15). If yes then you should print ti - 1 + 15. You can assume that t0 = 0 and then you don't have to care about some corner case at the beginning. Also, you can assume that tn + 1 = 91 or tn + 1 = 90 (both should work — do you see why?). If your program haven't found two consecutive numbers different by more than 15 then print 90. If you still have problems to solve this problem then check codes of other participants.182866062 673B - Problems for Round(invented by Errichto)Some prefix of problems must belong to one division, and the remaining suffix must belong to the other division. Thus, we can say that we should choose the place (between two numbers) where we split problems. Each pair ai, bi (let's say that ai < bi) means that the splitting place must be between ai and bi. In other words, it must be on the right from ai and on the left from bi.For each pair if ai > bi then we swap these two numbers. Now, the splitting place must be on the right from a1, a2, ..., am, so it must be on the right from A = max(a1, a2, ..., am). In linear time you can calculate A, and similarly calculate B = min(b1, ..., bm). Then, the answer is B - A. It may turn out that A > B though but we don't want to print a negative answer. So, we should print max(0, B - A).182866333 673C - Bear and Colors(invented by Errichto)We are going to iterate over all intervals. Let's first fix the left end of the interval and denote it by i. Now, we iterate over the right end j. When we go from j to j + 1 then we get one extra ball with color cj + 1. In one global array cnt[n] we can keep the number of occurrences of each color (we can clear the array for each new i). We should increase by one cnt[cj + 1] and then check whether cj + 1 becomes a new dominant color. But how to do it?Additionally, let's keep one variable best with the current dominant color. When we go to j + 1 then we should whether cnt[cj + 1] > cnt[best] or (cnt[cj + 1] =  = cnt[best] and cj + 1 < best). The second condition checks which color has smaller index (in case of a tie). And we must increase answer[best] by one then because we know that best is dominant for the current interval. At the end, print values answer[1], answer[2], ..., answer[n].182866634 673D - Bear and Two Paths(invented by Errichto)There is no solution if n = 4 or k ≤ n. But for n ≥ 5 and k ≥ n + 1 you can construct the following graph:Here, cities (x1, x2, ..., xn - 4) denote other cities in any order you choose (cities different than a, b, c, d). You should print (a, c, x1, x2, ..., xn - 4, d, b) in the first line, and (c, a, x1, x2, ..., xn - 4, b, d) in the second line.Two not very hard challenges for you. Are you able to prove that the answer doesn't exist for k = n? Can you solve the problem if the four given cities don't have to be distinct but it's guaranteed that a ≠ b and c ≠ d?182866835 673E - Levels and Regions(invented by Radewoosh)When we repeat something and each time we have probability p to succeed then the expected number or tries is , till we succeed. How to calculate the expected time for one region [low, high]? For each i in some moment we will try to beat this level and then there will be S = tlow + tlow + 1 + ... + ti tokens in the bag, including ti tokens allowing us to beat this new level. The probability to succeed is , so the expected time is . So, in total we should sum up values for i < j. Ok, we managed to understand the actual problem. You can now stop and try to find a slow solution in O(n2·k). Hint: use the dynamic programming. Let dp[i][j] denote the optimal result for prefix of i levels, if we divide them into j regions. Let pre[i] denote the result for region containing levels 1, 2, ..., i (think how to calculate it easily with one loop). Let sum[i] denote the sum of tj for all 1 ≤ j ≤ i. Let rev[i] denote the sum of for all 1 ≤ j ≤ i. Now let's write formula for dp[i][j], as the minimum over l denoting the end of the previous region: So we can use convex hull trick to calculate it in O(n·k). You should also get AC with a bit slower divide&conquer trick, if it's implemented carefully.182866966 673F - Bearish Fanpages(invented by Radewoosh)Let's say that every company has one parent (a company it follows). Also, every copmany has some (maybe empty) set of children. It's crucial that sets of children are disjoint.For each company let's keep (and always update) one value, equal to the sum of: the income from its own fanpage the income from its children's fanpages It turns out that after each query only the above sum changes only for a few values. If a starts to follows b then you should care about a, b, par[a], par[b], par[par[a]]. And maybe par[par[b]] and par[par[par[a]]] if you want to be sure. You can stop reading now for a moment and analyze that indeed other companies will keep the same sum, described above.Ok, but so far we don't count the income coming from parent's fanpage. But, for each company we can store all its children in one set. All children have the same \"income from parent's fanpage\" because they have the same parent. So, in set you can keep children sorted by the sum described above. Then, we should always puts the extreme elements from sets in one global set. In the global set you care about the total income, equal to the sum described above and this new \"income from parent\". Check codes for details. The complexity should be , with big constant factor.182867477 674E - Bear and Destroying Subtrees(invented by Errichto)Let dp[v][h] denote the probability that subtree v (if attacked now) would have height at most h. The first observation is that we don't care about big h because it's very unlikely that a path with e.g. 100 edges will survive. Let's later talk about choosing h and now let's say that it's enough to consider h up to 60.When we should answer a query for subtree v then we should sum up h·(dp[v][h] - dp[v][h - 1]) to get the answer. The other query is harder.Let's say that a new vertex is attached to vertex v. Then, among dp[v][0], dp[v][1], dp[v][2], ... only dp[v][0] changes (other values stay the same). Also, one value dp[par[v]][1] changes, and so does dp[par[par[v]]][2] and so on. You should iterate over MAX_H vertices (each time going to parent) and update the corresponding value. TODO — puts here come formula for updating value.The complexity is O(q·MAX_H). You may think that MAX_H = 30 is enough because is small enough. Unfortunately, there exist malicious tests. Consider a tree with paths from root, each with length 31. Now, we talk about the probability of magnitude: 1 - (1 - (1 / 2)d)N / dwhich is more than 10 - 6 for d = 30.http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1+-+(1-(1%2F2)%5Ed)%5E(N%2Fd)+for+N+%3D+500000+and+d+%3D+30182867218 674F - Bears and Juice(invented by Radewoosh)Let's start with O(q·p2) approach, with the dynamic programming. Let dp[days][beds] denote the maximum number of barrels to win if there are days days left and beds places to sleep left. Then: Here, i represents the number of bears who will go to sleep. If the same i bears drink from the same X barrels and this exact set of bears go to sleep then on the next day we only have X barrels to consider (wine is in one of them). And for X = dp[days - 1][beds - i] we will manage to find the wine then.And how to compute the dp faster? Organizers have ugly solution with something similar to meet in the middle. We calculate dp for first q2 / 3 days and later we use multiply vectors by matrix, to get further answers faster. The complexity is equivalent to O(p·q) but only because roughly q = p3. We saw shortest codes though. How to do it guys?You may wonder why there was 232 instead of 109 + 7. It was to fight with making the brute force faster. For 109 + 7 you could add sum +  = dp[a][b]·dp[c][d] about 15 times (using unsigned long long's) and only then compute modulo. You would then get very fast solution.182867669 674G - Choosing Ads(invented by qwerty787788)Let's first consider a solution processing query in O(n) time, but using O(1) extra memory. If p = 51%, it's a well known problem. We should store one element and some balance. When processing next element, if it's equal to our, we increase balance. If it's not equal, and balance is positive, we decrease it. If it is zero, we getting new element as stored, and setting balance to 1.To generalize to case of elements, which are at least 100/k%, we will do next. Let's store k elements with balance for each. When getting a new element, if it's in set of our 5, we will add 1 to it's balance. If we have less, than 5 elements, just add new element with balance 1. Else, if there is element with balance 0, replace it by new element with balance one. Else, subtract 1 from each balance. The meaning of such balance becomes more mysterious, but it's not hard to check, that value is at least 100/k% of all elements, it's balance will be positive.To generalize even more, we can join two of such balanced set. To do that, we sum balances of elements of all sets, than join sets to one, and then removing elements with smallest balance one, by one, untill there is k elements in set. To remove element, we should subtract it's balance from all other balances.And now, we can merge this sets on segment, using segment tree. This solution will have complexity like n * log(n) * MERGE, where MERGE is time of merging two structures. Probably, when k is 5, k2 / 2 is fastest way. But the profit is we don't need complex structures to check which elements are really in top, so solution works much faster.",

Имеем R1 = 6, R2 = 11, R3 = 16, так что ответ равен . Проанализируем стратегию для сценария с 2 днями. Всего есть R2 = 11 бочек, и 10 из них содержат сок.  В первую ночь i-й медведь выбирает бочку i.   Если одна из 5 бочек содержит вино, то соответствующий медведь отправится спать. Таким образом, медведи выигрывают, потому они теперь знают где находится вино и есть хотя бы один не спящий медведь.  Если никто из 5 медведей не ушёл спать, то на вторую ночь i-й медведь пьёт из бочки 5 + i.   Если хотя бы одна из бочек 6 – 10 содержит вино, то соответствующий медведь отправится спать, и медведи победят.  Если никто из медведей опять не уйдёт спать, то они точно будут знать, что вино находится в бочке 11.   Во втором примере есть только один медведь. Он не может ничего пить (то есть он выбирает пустое множество бочек каждую ночь), потому что если он уйдёт спать, то медведи сразу проигрывают. Таким образом, для любого числа дней Ri = 1 и ответ равен .",

          "content": "Editorial was created by Errichto, but he said that he has enough contribution, so I'm posting it for you. ;)1 673A - Bear and Game(invented by GlebsHP — thanks!)You are supposed to implement what is described in the statement. When you read numbers ti, check if two consecutive numbers differ by more than 15 (i.e. ti - ti - 1 > 15). If yes then you should print ti - 1 + 15. You can assume that t0 = 0 and then you don't have to care about some corner case at the beginning. Also, you can assume that tn + 1 = 91 or tn + 1 = 90 (both should work — do you see why?). If your program haven't found two consecutive numbers different by more than 15 then print 90. If you still have problems to solve this problem then check codes of other participants.182866062 673B - Problems for Round(invented by Errichto)Some prefix of problems must belong to one division, and the remaining suffix must belong to the other division. Thus, we can say that we should choose the place (between two numbers) where we split problems. Each pair ai, bi (let's say that ai < bi) means that the splitting place must be between ai and bi. In other words, it must be on the right from ai and on the left from bi.For each pair if ai > bi then we swap these two numbers. Now, the splitting place must be on the right from a1, a2, ..., am, so it must be on the right from A = max(a1, a2, ..., am). In linear time you can calculate A, and similarly calculate B = min(b1, ..., bm). Then, the answer is B - A. It may turn out that A > B though but we don't want to print a negative answer. So, we should print max(0, B - A).182866333 673C - Bear and Colors(invented by Errichto)We are going to iterate over all intervals. Let's first fix the left end of the interval and denote it by i. Now, we iterate over the right end j. When we go from j to j + 1 then we get one extra ball with color cj + 1. In one global array cnt[n] we can keep the number of occurrences of each color (we can clear the array for each new i). We should increase by one cnt[cj + 1] and then check whether cj + 1 becomes a new dominant color. But how to do it?Additionally, let's keep one variable best with the current dominant color. When we go to j + 1 then we should whether cnt[cj + 1] > cnt[best] or (cnt[cj + 1] =  = cnt[best] and cj + 1 < best). The second condition checks which color has smaller index (in case of a tie). And we must increase answer[best] by one then because we know that best is dominant for the current interval. At the end, print values answer[1], answer[2], ..., answer[n].182866634 673D - Bear and Two Paths(invented by Errichto)There is no solution if n = 4 or k ≤ n. But for n ≥ 5 and k ≥ n + 1 you can construct the following graph:Here, cities (x1, x2, ..., xn - 4) denote other cities in any order you choose (cities different than a, b, c, d). You should print (a, c, x1, x2, ..., xn - 4, d, b) in the first line, and (c, a, x1, x2, ..., xn - 4, b, d) in the second line.Two not very hard challenges for you. Are you able to prove that the answer doesn't exist for k = n? Can you solve the problem if the four given cities don't have to be distinct but it's guaranteed that a ≠ b and c ≠ d?182866835 673E - Levels and Regions(invented by Radewoosh)When we repeat something and each time we have probability p to succeed then the expected number or tries is , till we succeed. How to calculate the expected time for one region [low, high]? For each i in some moment we will try to beat this level and then there will be S = tlow + tlow + 1 + ... + ti tokens in the bag, including ti tokens allowing us to beat this new level. The probability to succeed is , so the expected time is . So, in total we should sum up values for i < j. Ok, we managed to understand the actual problem. You can now stop and try to find a slow solution in O(n2·k). Hint: use the dynamic programming. Let dp[i][j] denote the optimal result for prefix of i levels, if we divide them into j regions. Let pre[i] denote the result for region containing levels 1, 2, ..., i (think how to calculate it easily with one loop). Let sum[i] denote the sum of tj for all 1 ≤ j ≤ i. Let rev[i] denote the sum of for all 1 ≤ j ≤ i. Now let's write formula for dp[i][j], as the minimum over l denoting the end of the previous region: So we can use convex hull trick to calculate it in O(n·k). You should also get AC with a bit slower divide&conquer trick, if it's implemented carefully.182866966 673F - Bearish Fanpages(invented by Radewoosh)Let's say that every company has one parent (a company it follows). Also, every copmany has some (maybe empty) set of children. It's crucial that sets of children are disjoint.For each company let's keep (and always update) one value, equal to the sum of: the income from its own fanpage the income from its children's fanpages It turns out that after each query only the above sum changes only for a few values. If a starts to follows b then you should care about a, b, par[a], par[b], par[par[a]]. And maybe par[par[b]] and par[par[par[a]]] if you want to be sure. You can stop reading now for a moment and analyze that indeed other companies will keep the same sum, described above.Ok, but so far we don't count the income coming from parent's fanpage. But, for each company we can store all its children in one set. All children have the same \"income from parent's fanpage\" because they have the same parent. So, in set you can keep children sorted by the sum described above. Then, we should always puts the extreme elements from sets in one global set. In the global set you care about the total income, equal to the sum described above and this new \"income from parent\". Check codes for details. The complexity should be , with big constant factor.182867477 674E - Bear and Destroying Subtrees(invented by Errichto)Let dp[v][h] denote the probability that subtree v (if attacked now) would have height at most h. The first observation is that we don't care about big h because it's very unlikely that a path with e.g. 100 edges will survive. Let's later talk about choosing h and now let's say that it's enough to consider h up to 60.When we should answer a query for subtree v then we should sum up h·(dp[v][h] - dp[v][h - 1]) to get the answer. The other query is harder.Let's say that a new vertex is attached to vertex v. Then, among dp[v][0], dp[v][1], dp[v][2], ... only dp[v][0] changes (other values stay the same). Also, one value dp[par[v]][1] changes, and so does dp[par[par[v]]][2] and so on. You should iterate over MAX_H vertices (each time going to parent) and update the corresponding value. TODO — puts here come formula for updating value.The complexity is O(q·MAX_H). You may think that MAX_H = 30 is enough because is small enough. Unfortunately, there exist malicious tests. Consider a tree with paths from root, each with length 31. Now, we talk about the probability of magnitude: 1 - (1 - (1 / 2)d)N / dwhich is more than 10 - 6 for d = 30.http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1+-+(1-(1%2F2)%5Ed)%5E(N%2Fd)+for+N+%3D+500000+and+d+%3D+30182867218 674F - Bears and Juice(invented by Radewoosh)Let's start with O(q·p2) approach, with the dynamic programming. Let dp[days][beds] denote the maximum number of barrels to win if there are days days left and beds places to sleep left. Then: Here, i represents the number of bears who will go to sleep. If the same i bears drink from the same X barrels and this exact set of bears go to sleep then on the next day we only have X barrels to consider (wine is in one of them). And for X = dp[days - 1][beds - i] we will manage to find the wine then.And how to compute the dp faster? Organizers have ugly solution with something similar to meet in the middle. We calculate dp for first q2 / 3 days and later we use multiply vectors by matrix, to get further answers faster. The complexity is equivalent to O(p·q) but only because roughly q = p3. We saw shortest codes though. How to do it guys?You may wonder why there was 232 instead of 109 + 7. It was to fight with making the brute force faster. For 109 + 7 you could add sum +  = dp[a][b]·dp[c][d] about 15 times (using unsigned long long's) and only then compute modulo. You would then get very fast solution.182867669 674G - Choosing Ads(invented by qwerty787788)Let's first consider a solution processing query in O(n) time, but using O(1) extra memory. If p = 51%, it's a well known problem. We should store one element and some balance. When processing next element, if it's equal to our, we increase balance. If it's not equal, and balance is positive, we decrease it. If it is zero, we getting new element as stored, and setting balance to 1.To generalize to case of elements, which are at least 100/k%, we will do next. Let's store k elements with balance for each. When getting a new element, if it's in set of our 5, we will add 1 to it's balance. If we have less, than 5 elements, just add new element with balance 1. Else, if there is element with balance 0, replace it by new element with balance one. Else, subtract 1 from each balance. The meaning of such balance becomes more mysterious, but it's not hard to check, that value is at least 100/k% of all elements, it's balance will be positive.To generalize even more, we can join two of such balanced set. To do that, we sum balances of elements of all sets, than join sets to one, and then removing elements with smallest balance one, by one, untill there is k elements in set. To remove element, we should subtract it's balance from all other balances.And now, we can merge this sets on segment, using segment tree. This solution will have complexity like n * log(n) * MERGE, where MERGE is time of merging two structures. Probably, when k is 5, k2 / 2 is fastest way. But the profit is we don't need complex structures to check which elements are really in top, so solution works much faster.",

          "content": "Hi everybody.The VK Cup Round 3 is coming (exact time).The duration will be longer than usual, likely 3 hours.As usually in VK Cup, there will be three contests — div1, div2, official one. All of them are rated. Div1 and div2 versions are for individual participants, not for teams.Setters are Radewoosh, Errichto and qwerty787788. I think that (some) problems are extremely interesting and I really wish I could participate. Thanks to GlebsHP and MikeMirzayanov, we wouldn't have a round without them. Also, thanks to AlexFetisov and winger for testing.We will later inform about the final duration. Maybe we will inform about the number of problems and scoring.I wish you great fun and no frustrating bugs. And Limak wishes you good luck!UPD The contest will last 3 hours. ADJUSTED POINTS DROP — Points will decrease with such a speed that submitting a problem at the end would give you the same number of points as in standard 2-hour rounds. I updated testers above. Top50 in the \"Div1 Edition\" contest will get t-shirts. Have I already said \"I wish I could participate\"? UPD 2There are 9 problems. Div2 gets problems 1 - 6, and Div1+R3 gets 3 - 9. It means that there are 4 shared problems.Division 2: 500 750 1000 1500 2250 3000R3 & Div1: 500 1000 1750 2250 2250 3000 3000UPD 3Enjoy the editorialUPD 4The system testing is over.

When you read numbers ti, check if two consecutive numbers differ by more than 15 (i.e. ti - ti - 1 > 15). If yes then you should print ti - 1 + 15. You can assume that t0 = 0 and then you don't have to care about some corner case at the beginning. Also, you can assume that tn + 1 = 91 or tn + 1 = 90 (both should work — do you see why?). If your program haven't found two consecutive numbers different by more than 15 then print 90. If you still have problems to solve this problem then check codes of other participants.182866062 673B - Problems for Round(invented by Errichto)Some prefix of problems must belong to one division, and the remaining suffix must belong to the other division. Thus, we can say that we should choose the place (between two numbers) where we split problems. Each pair ai, bi (let's say that ai < bi) means that the splitting place must be between ai and bi. In other words, it must be on the right from ai and on the left from bi.For each pair if ai > bi then we swap these two numbers. Now, the splitting place must be on the right from a1, a2, ..., am, so it must be on the right from A = max(a1, a2, ..., am). In linear time you can calculate A, and similarly calculate B = min(b1, ..., bm). Then, the answer is B - A. It may turn out that A > B though but we don't want to print a negative answer. So, we should print max(0, B - A).182866333 673C - Bear and Colors(invented by Errichto)We are going to iterate over all intervals. Let's first fix the left end of the interval and denote it by i. Now, we iterate over the right end j. When we go from j to j + 1 then we get one extra ball with color cj + 1. In one global array cnt[n] we can keep the number of occurrences of each color (we can clear the array for each new i). We should increase by one cnt[cj + 1] and then check whether cj + 1 becomes a new dominant color. But how to do it?Additionally, let's keep one variable best with the current dominant color. When we go to j + 1 then we should whether cnt[cj + 1] > cnt[best] or (cnt[cj + 1] =  = cnt[best] and cj + 1 < best). The second condition checks which color has smaller index (in case of a tie). And we must increase answer[best] by one then because we know that best is dominant for the current interval. At the end, print values answer[1], answer[2], ..., answer[n].182866634 673D - Bear and Two Paths(invented by Errichto)There is no solution if n = 4 or k ≤ n. But for n ≥ 5 and k ≥ n + 1 you can construct the following graph:Here, cities (x1, x2, ..., xn - 4) denote other cities in any order you choose (cities different than a, b, c, d). You should print (a, c, x1, x2, ..., xn - 4, d, b) in the first line, and (c, a, x1, x2, ..., xn - 4, b, d) in the second line.Two not very hard challenges for you. Are you able to prove that the answer doesn't exist for k = n? Can you solve the problem if the four given cities don't have to be distinct but it's guaranteed that a ≠ b and c ≠ d?182866835 673E - Levels and Regions(invented by Radewoosh)When we repeat something and each time we have probability p to succeed then the expected number or tries is , till we succeed. How to calculate the expected time for one region [low, high]? For each i in some moment we will try to beat this level and then there will be S = tlow + tlow + 1 + ... + ti tokens in the bag, including ti tokens allowing us to beat this new level. The probability to succeed is , so the expected time is . So, in total we should sum up values for i < j. Ok, we managed to understand the actual problem. You can now stop and try to find a slow solution in O(n2·k). Hint: use the dynamic programming. Let dp[i][j] denote the optimal result for prefix of i levels, if we divide them into j regions. Let pre[i] denote the result for region containing levels 1, 2, ..., i (think how to calculate it easily with one loop). Let sum[i] denote the sum of tj for all 1 ≤ j ≤ i. Let rev[i] denote the sum of for all 1 ≤ j ≤ i. Now let's write formula for dp[i][j], as the minimum over l denoting the end of the previous region: So we can use convex hull trick to calculate it in O(n·k). You should also get AC with a bit slower divide&conquer trick, if it's implemented carefully.182866966 673F - Bearish Fanpages(invented by Radewoosh)Let's say that every company has one parent (a company it follows). Also, every copmany has some (maybe empty) set of children. It's crucial that sets of children are disjoint.For each company let's keep (and always update) one value, equal to the sum of: the income from its own fanpage the income from its children's fanpages It turns out that after each query only the above sum changes only for a few values. If a starts to follows b then you should care about a, b, par[a], par[b], par[par[a]]. And maybe par[par[b]] and par[par[par[a]]] if you want to be sure. You can stop reading now for a moment and analyze that indeed other companies will keep the same sum, described above.Ok, but so far we don't count the income coming from parent's fanpage. But, for each company we can store all its children in one set. All children have the same \"income from parent's fanpage\" because they have the same parent. So, in set you can keep children sorted by the sum described above. Then, we should always puts the extreme elements from sets in one global set. In the global set you care about the total income, equal to the sum described above and this new \"income from parent\". Check codes for details. The complexity should be , with big constant factor.182867477 674E - Bear and Destroying Subtrees(invented by Errichto)Let dp[v][h] denote the probability that subtree v (if attacked now) would have height at most h. The first observation is that we don't care about big h because it's very unlikely that a path with e.g. 100 edges will survive. Let's later talk about choosing h and now let's say that it's enough to consider h up to 60.When we should answer a query for subtree v then we should sum up h·(dp[v][h] - dp[v][h - 1]) to get the answer. The other query is harder.Let's say that a new vertex is attached to vertex v. Then, among dp[v][0], dp[v][1], dp[v][2], ... only dp[v][0] changes (other values stay the same). Also, one value dp[par[v]][1] changes, and so does dp[par[par[v]]][2] and so on. You should iterate over MAX_H vertices (each time going to parent) and update the corresponding value. TODO — puts here come formula for updating value.The complexity is O(q·MAX_H). You may think that MAX_H = 30 is enough because is small enough. Unfortunately, there exist malicious tests. Consider a tree with paths from root, each with length 31. Now, we talk about the probability of magnitude: 1 - (1 - (1 / 2)d)N / dwhich is more than 10 - 6 for d = 30.http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1+-+(1-(1%2F2)%5Ed)%5E(N%2Fd)+for+N+%3D+500000+and+d+%3D+30182867218 674F - Bears and Juice(invented by Radewoosh)Let's start with O(q·p2) approach, with the dynamic programming. Let dp[days][beds] denote the maximum number of barrels to win if there are days days left and beds places to sleep left. Then: Here, i represents the number of bears who will go to sleep. If the same i bears drink from the same X barrels and this exact set of bears go to sleep then on the next day we only have X barrels to consider (wine is in one of them). And for X = dp[days - 1][beds - i] we will manage to find the wine then.And how to compute the dp faster? Organizers have ugly solution with something similar to meet in the middle. We calculate dp for first q2 / 3 days and later we use multiply vectors by matrix, to get further answers faster. The complexity is equivalent to O(p·q) but only because roughly q = p3. We saw shortest codes though. How to do it guys?You may wonder why there was 232 instead of 109 + 7. It was to fight with making the brute force faster. For 109 + 7 you could add sum +  = dp[a][b]·dp[c][d] about 15 times (using unsigned long long's) and only then compute modulo. You would then get very fast solution.182867669 674G - Choosing Ads(invented by qwerty787788)Let's first consider a solution processing query in O(n) time, but using O(1) extra memory. If p = 51%, it's a well known problem. We should store one element and some balance. When processing next element, if it's equal to our, we increase balance. If it's not equal, and balance is positive, we decrease it. If it is zero, we getting new element as stored, and setting balance to 1.To generalize to case of elements, which are at least 100/k%, we will do next. Let's store k elements with balance for each. When getting a new element, if it's in set of our 5, we will add 1 to it's balance. If we have less, than 5 elements, just add new element with balance 1. Else, if there is element with balance 0, replace it by new element with balance one. Else, subtract 1 from each balance. The meaning of such balance becomes more mysterious, but it's not hard to check, that value is at least 100/k% of all elements, it's balance will be positive.To generalize even more, we can join two of such balanced set. To do that, we sum balances of elements of all sets, than join sets to one, and then removing elements with smallest balance one, by one, untill there is k elements in set. To remove element, we should subtract it's balance from all other balances.And now, we can merge this sets on segment, using segment tree. This solution will have complexity like n * log(n) * MERGE, where MERGE is time of merging two structures. Probably, when k is 5, k2 / 2 is fastest way. But the profit is we don't need complex structures to check which elements are really in top, so solution works much faster.",

          "content": "Hey Codeforces!The Elimination Round of the CROC 2016 Championship will take place on Friday, March 18 at 16:35 UTC. After our last round, Yang Liu (desert97), Michael Kural (pi37) and I realized that we haven't had enough, so we joined forces with Kevin Sun (ksun48) and Daniel Chiu (waterfalls) to prepare another problem set for you guys. Our contest will be for combined divisions and consist of seven problems. And although only those who pass the Qualification Round can participate officially, the round will be open to and rated for all Codeforces users. As always, we'll be taking the tractor to Bovinia for some farmland algorithmic adventures with Farmer John, Bessie and her best friend Elsie!Before we begin, we'd like to thank GlebsHP for doing a wonderful job as contest coordinator—we'd be hopeless without you. We would also like to thank MikeMirzayanov and the Codeforces staff for creating the awesome Codeforces and Polygon platforms. And finally, we're immensely grateful to abacadaea for providing one of the problem ideas and to winger and AlexFetisov for test solving our round.Formally, there will be two rounds on the same problem set (both rated): CROC 2016 — Elimination Round: for registered Championship participants who have passed the Qualification, CROC 2016 — Elimination Round (Rated Unofficial Edition): for all others. To take part in the official round you have to be registered for the Championship and solve at least one problem in Qualification round. Both the elimination round and its unofficial edition will be rated. The only difference is that the top 50 participants in the official round will be invited to join the Finals in Moscow. Finalists will be responsible for organizing their trip (tickets, hotel, visas and so on). Each participant may claim reimbursement for transportation expenses not exceeding ~135 USD. Invitations should be accepted no later than March 25.We hope you enjoy our problems and our cow-flavored text even more than you did last time! Good luck!UPD1: System testing is delayed because we are investigating some technical issues.UPD2: The editorial has been posted here. Thanks for participating!UPD3: Since last ~15 minutes judging system was incorrectly configured for F in the contest \"CROC 2016 — Elimination Round\" (it is interesting story how it happened), you may appeal your rating change if it affected you much. If you have submitted a solution for F in last 15 minutes and you have strong arguments why incorrect verdict (WA/RE on the test 1) significantly affected your place, please write MikeMirzayanov to make your participation unrated. Sorry about the issue. You can do it before March, 19, 23:59 (UTC).UPD4: I'd like to congratulate the winners of each round, as well as the top 50 in the Elimination Round for progressing to the CROC 2016 Championship Finals! In addition, Petr and jqdai0815 deserve a special shoutout for solving all seven problems!CROC 2016 — Elimination Round Petr tourist vepifanov rng_58 I_love_Tanya_Romanova CROC 2016 — Elimination Round (Rated Unofficial Edition) jqdai0815 anta Alex_2oo8 NaiveNaive eddy1021",

          "content": "645A - Amity AssessmentIdea: yummyOne solution is to just brute force and use DFS to try all the possibilities. Alternatively, note that two puzzles can be changed to each other if and only if the A, B, and C have the same orientation—clockwise or counterclockwise—in the puzzle. A third option, since the number of possibilities is so small, is to simply classify all of the 4! = 24 configurations by hand. Code#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\n\nstring b, b1, b2, e, e1, e2;\n\nint main(){\n cin >> b1 >> b2 >> e1 >> e2;\n swap(b2[0], b2[1]);\n swap(e2[0], e2[1]);\n b = b1 + b2;\n e = e1 + e2;\n b.erase(b.find('X'), 1);\n e.erase(e.find('X'), 1);\n if((b + b).find(e) != string::npos){\n\tcout << \"YESn\";\n } else {\n\tcout << \"NOn\";\n }\n}\n645B - Mischievous Mess MakersIdea: ksun48Loosely speaking, we’re trying to reverse the array as much as possible.Intuitively, the optimal solution seems to be to switch the first and last cow, then the second and second-to-last cow, and so on for k minutes, unless the sequence is reversed already, in which case we are done. But how can we show that these moves give the optimal messiness?It is clear when 2·k ≥ n - 1 that we can reverse the array with this method.However, when 2·k < n - 1, there are going to be cows that we must not have not moved a single time. Since in each move we swap at most 2 cows, there must be at least n - 2·k cows that we have not touched, with pi = i. Two untouched cows i and j must have pi < pj, so there must be at least pairs of cows which are ordered correctly.In fact, if we follow the above process, we get that pi = (n + 1) - i for the first k and last k cows, while pi = i for the middle n - 2·k cows. From this we can see that the both i < j and pi < pj happen only when i and j are in the middle n - 2·k cows. Therefore we know our algorithm is optimal.An O(k) solution, therefore, is to count how many incorrectly ordered pairs (i, j) are created at each step and add them up. When we swap cow i and (n + 1) - i in step i, this creates 1 + 2·(n - 2i) more pairs. So the answer will be .We can reduce this to O(1) by using our earlier observation, that every pair except those pairs are unordered, which gives total pairs (i, j). Note that this does always not fit in a 32-bit integer.

Thus we can loop over all such sets of rooms with a sliding window in linear time. To check the next set of rooms, we simply advance each endpoint of our interval to the next empty room. Every time we do this, we need to compute the optimal placement of Farmer John’s room. We can maintain the position of his room with two pointers—as we slide our window of rooms to the right, the optimal position of Farmer John’s room should always move to the right or remain the same. This solution runs in O(n). Alternatively, we can use binary search or an STL set to find the best placement for Farmer John’s room as we iterate over the intervals of rooms. The complexity of these approaches is . Code#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint N, K, res = 1e9;\nstring S;\n\nint next(int i){ // finds the next empty room\n do {\n i += 1;\n } while(i < N && S[i] == '1');\n return i;\n}\n\nint main(){\n cin >> N >> K >> S;\n int l = next(-1), m = l, r = l;\n for(int i = 0; i < K; i++){ // sets up the sliding window\n r = next(r);\n }\n while(r < N){\n while(max(m - l, r - m) > max(next(m) - l, r - next(m))){\n m = next(m);\n }\n res = min(res, max(m - l, r - m));\n l = next(l);\n r = next(r);\n }\n cout << res << 'n';\n}645D - Robot Rapping Results ReportIdea: abacadaeaThe robots will become fully sorted if and only if there exists a path with n vertices in the directed graph defined by the match results. Because it is guaranteed that the results are not contradictory, this graph must be directed and acyclic—a DAG. Thus we can compute the longest path in this DAG via dynamic programming or a toposort.We now have two cases. First, if the longest path contains n vertices, then it must uniquely define the ordering of the robots. This means the answer is the time at which the last edge was added to this path. Otherwise, if the longest path has fewer than n vertices, then multiple orderings satisfy the results and you should print  - 1. Note that this algorithm runs in O(n + m).Another solution to this problem binary searches on the answer. For some k, consider only those edges that were added before time k. We can determine if the robots could be totally ordered at time k by running a toposort and checking if the longest path covers all n vertices. This might be more intuitive for some, but has a complexity of .

Let a[i] denote the number of distinct subsequences of the string that end in the letter i. Appending the letter j to a string only changes the value of a[j]. Note that the new a[j] becomes —we can have the single letter j, or append j to any of our old subsequences.The key observation is that no matter what character j we choose to append, a[j] will always end up the same. This suggests a greedy algorithm—always appending the character j with the smallest a[j]. But how do we know which a[j] is minimal while maintaining their values modulo 109 + 7?The final observation is that if the last occurrence of j is after the last occurrence of j' in our string, then a[j] > a[j']. This is true because appending j to the string makes a[j] larger than all other a[i]. So instead of choosing the minimum a[i], we can always choose the letter that appeared least recently. Since the sequence of letters we append becomes periodic, our solution runs in . Of course, we can also find the least recently used letter with less efficient approaches, obtaining solutions with complexity O((L + n)k).

One quickly notes that it is too slow to loop over all choices of k flowers, as there could be up to choices of k species.So how can we compute a sum over terms? Well, we will definitely need to use the properties of the gcd function. If we figure out for each integer a ≤ 106 how many times occurs in the sum (let this be g(a)), then our answer will be equal to overall all a.It seems that if d(a) is the number of multiples of a in our sequence, then there are k-tuples which have gcd a. Yet there is something wrong with this reasoning: some of those k-tuples can have gcd 2a, or 3a, or any multiple of a. In fact, , the number of gcds which are a multiple of a. We will try to write as a sum of these . We’ll take an example, when a ranges from 1 to 4. The sum we wish to compute is g(1) + 2g(2) + 3g(3) + 4g(4) which can be written as (g(1) + g(2) + g(3) + g(4)) + (g(2) + g(4)) + 2(g(3)) + 2(g(4)), or In general, we want to find coefficients pi such that we can write as . Equating coefficients of g(a) on both sides, we get that . (The mathematically versed reader will note that pi = φ(i), Euler's totient function, but this is not necessary to solve the problem.)We can thus precalculate all pi in using a recursive formula: . We can also precalculate for each l ≤ 200000, so in order to output after each query we should keep track of the values of the function d(i), the number of multiples of i. When receiving ci flowers, we only need to update d for the divisors of ci and add . If we precompute the list of divisors of every integer using a sieve or sqrt checking, each update requires O(divisors).Thus the complexity of this algorithm is or preprocessing, and O((n + q)·max(divisors)).

It works as follows:First, let’s try to solve the smaller case where we only have two points. Let be the line passing through xi and xj. We want to compute the difference of relative to P and Q. Define P’ as the reflection of P over . By the triangle inequality, we have |PX - QX| = |P’X - QX| ≤ P’Q. Equality can be achieved when X, P’ and Q are collinear—that is, when X is the intersection of and line P’Q. (If and P’Q are parallel, we can imagine that they intersect at infinity.) Therefore, the difference of a line relative to P and Q is the distance from P’ to Q.We can also think about P’ in a different way. Let Ci be the circle with center xi that pases through P. Then P’ is the second intersection of the two circles Ci and Cj. Thus our problem of finding a line with minimum difference becomes equivalent to finding the intersection among {Ci} that lies closest to Q. This last part we can do with a binary search.Consider the problem of checking if two circles Ci and Cj intersect at a point within a distance r of Q. In other words, we wish to check if they intersect inside a circle S of radius r centered at Q. Let Ai and Aj be the arcs of S contained by Ci and Cj, respectively. Observe that Ci and Cj intersect inside the circle if and only if the two arcs overlap, but do not contain each other. Thus we can verify this condition for all pairs of points with a radial sweep line along the circle. Due to the binary search and the sorting necessary for the sweep line, this solution runs in , where P is the precision required.One might also wonder if precision will be an issue with all the calculations that we’re doing. It turns out that it won’t be, since our binary search will always stabilize the problem and get us very close to the answer. Here’s my original solution using a projective transformation:We begin by binary searching on the the minimum possible difference. Thus we wish to solve the decision problem \"Can a difference of k be achieved?\" Consider the hyperbola |PX - QX| = k. Note that our answer is affirmative if and only if a pair of outposts defines a line that does not intersect the hyperbola.Our next step is a reduction to an equivalent decision problem on a circle through a projective transformation. We express this transformation as the composition of two simpler operations. The first is an affine map that takes the hyperbola |PX - QX| = k to the unit hyperbola. The second maps homogenous coordinates (x, y, z) to (z, y, x). Under the latter, the unit hyperbola x2 - y2 = z2 goes to the unit circle x2 + y2 = z2.Because projective transformations preserve collinearity, a line intersecting the hyperbola is equivalent to a line intersecting the circle. Thus we want to know if any pair of the outposts' images defines a line that does not intersect the circle. We now map the image of each outpost to the minor arc on the unit circle defined by its tangents. (We disregard any points lying inside the circle.) Observe that our condition is equivalent to the existence of two intersecting arcs, neither of which contains the other. Verifying that two such arcs exist can be done with a priority queue and a radial sweep line in .The total complexity of our solution is therefore , where P is the precision that we need. It turns out that the implementation of this algorithm is actually pretty neat: Code#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\n\ntypedef long double ld;\n\nconst ld EPS = 1e-12;\nconst ld PI = acos(-1);\nconst int MAXN = 100005;\nint N;\nld A, X[MAXN], Y[MAXN];\n\nbool check(ld m){\n ld u = m / 2;\n ld v = sqrt(A * A - u * u);\n vector<pair<ld,ld>> ev;\n for(int i = 0; i < N; i++){\n ld x = 1, y = Y[i] / v, alpha;\n if(X[i] != 0){\n x *= u / X[i], y *= u / X[i];\n ld r = sqrt(x * x + y * y);\n if(r < 1) continue;\n alpha = acos(1 / r);\n } else {\n alpha = PI / 2;\n }\n ld base = atan2(y, x) - alpha;\n if(base < 0) base += 2 * PI;\n ev.push_back({base, base + 2 * alpha});\n }\n priority_queue<ld, vector<ld>, greater<ld>> pq;\n sort(ev.begin(), ev.end());\n for(int i = 0; i < 2; i++){\n for(int j = 0; j < ev.size(); j++){\n while(pq.size() && pq.top() < ev[j].first) pq.pop();\n if(pq.size() && pq.top() < ev[j].second) return 1;\n pq.push(ev[j].second);\n ev[j].first += 2 * PI;\n ev[j].second += 2 * PI;\n }\n }\n return 0;\n}\n\nint main(){\n ios::sync_with_stdio(0);\n cin >> N >> A;\n for(int i = 0; i < N; i++){\n cin >> X[i] >> Y[i];\n }\n ld lo = 0, hi = 2 * A;\n while(hi - lo > EPS){\n ld mid = (lo + hi) / 2;\n (check(mid) ? hi : lo) = mid;\n }\n cout << fixed << setprecision(10);\n cout << (lo + hi) / 2 << 'n';\n}",

          "content": "Привет, Codeforces!Отборочный этап чемпионата КРОК 2016 состоится в пятницу 18-го марта в 19:35 (московское время).После нашего крайнего раунда, Yang Liu (desert97), Michael Kural (pi37) и я поняли, что мы еще не завязали с подготовкой раундов. Мы объединили усилия с Kevin Sun (ksun48) и Daniel Chiu (waterfalls) чтобы предложить еще один раунд для вас. Этот раунд будет сразу для обоих дивизионов и будет состоять из 7 задач. Те из вас, кто прошел Квалификацию и зарегистрирован на Чемпионат примут участие в официальной редакции, остальные — в неофициальной (открытой для всех). Обе редакции будут рейтинговыми. Как всегда, вас ждет путешествие на тракторе в Бовинию с фермерско-алгоритмическими приключениями в компании фермера Джона, Бесси и ее лучшего друга Элси!Перед стартом хочется поблагодарить GlebsHP за блестящую работу в роли координатора. Глеб, без тебя не было бы никакой надежды провести этот раунд! Так же наша благодарность MikeMirzayanov и всей команде Codeforces за создание клевых платформ Codeforces и Polygon. Наконец, мы безмерно благодарны abacadaea за помощь с идеями задач, а winger и AlexFetisov за прорешку раунда.Формально, будут проведены два раунда на одном и том же комплекте задач (оба раунда рейтинговые): КРОК 2016 — Отборочный Раунд: для зарегистрированных на Чемпионат участников, кто прошел Квалификацию, КРОК 2016 — Отборочный Раунд (рейтинговая неофиц. редакция): для всех остальных. Вы можете принять участие в Раунде официально, если на момент регистрации в нем вы зарегистрированы на Чемпионат и решили в Квалификации хотя бы одну задачу. Еще раз напомним, что независимо от формы участия, ваш рейтинг будет обновлен по результатам раунда. Единственная различие — в случае успешного выступления официальные лучшие 50 участников будут приглашены на Финал в Москву. Организация поездки (билеты, гостиница, виза и всё остальное) — это полностью забота финалистов. Участникам Финала КРОК-2016 будут покрыты транспортные расходы на сумму не более 10000 рублей (предполагается проезд обыкновенным купейным вагоном, либо, по согласованию, эконом-перелет самолетом). До 25-го марта необходимо будет подтвердить желание и возможность принять участие в Финале. Участники Финала будут бороться за призы: 1 место — 100000 рублей 2 местo — 70000 рублей 3 местo — 50000 рублей Мы еще обновим пост информацией о разбалловке. Надеемся, что вам понравятся задачи и наши коровоориентированные тексты. Удачи!UPD3: Так как примерно 15 последних минут соревнования тестирующая система некорректно обрабатывала попытки по F в раунде \"КРОК 2016 — Отборочный Раунд\" (и это отдельная интересная история как так вышло), вы можете обжаловать ваше изменение рейтинга, если влияние этого инцидента на ваш результат велико. Если вы отсылали F в последние 15 минут и имеете веские аргументы почему некорректный вердикт (WA/RE на тесте 1) сильно повлиял на ваше место, то напишите MikeMirzayanov и ваше участие можно будет сделать нерейтинговым. Приносим извинения за эту накладку. Апелляцию надо написать до 02:59 20-го марта (московское время).",

          "content": "645A - Amity AssessmentIdea: yummyOne solution is to just brute force and use DFS to try all the possibilities. Alternatively, note that two puzzles can be changed to each other if and only if the A, B, and C have the same orientation—clockwise or counterclockwise—in the puzzle. A third option, since the number of possibilities is so small, is to simply classify all of the 4! = 24 configurations by hand. Code#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\n\nstring b, b1, b2, e, e1, e2;\n\nint main(){\n cin >> b1 >> b2 >> e1 >> e2;\n swap(b2[0], b2[1]);\n swap(e2[0], e2[1]);\n b = b1 + b2;\n e = e1 + e2;\n b.erase(b.find('X'), 1);\n e.erase(e.find('X'), 1);\n if((b + b).find(e) != string::npos){\n\tcout << \"YESn\";\n } else {\n\tcout << \"NOn\";\n }\n}\n645B - Mischievous Mess MakersIdea: ksun48Loosely speaking, we’re trying to reverse the array as much as possible.Intuitively, the optimal solution seems to be to switch the first and last cow, then the second and second-to-last cow, and so on for k minutes, unless the sequence is reversed already, in which case we are done. But how can we show that these moves give the optimal messiness?It is clear when 2·k ≥ n - 1 that we can reverse the array with this method.However, when 2·k < n - 1, there are going to be cows that we must not have not moved a single time. Since in each move we swap at most 2 cows, there must be at least n - 2·k cows that we have not touched, with pi = i. Two untouched cows i and j must have pi < pj, so there must be at least pairs of cows which are ordered correctly.In fact, if we follow the above process, we get that pi = (n + 1) - i for the first k and last k cows, while pi = i for the middle n - 2·k cows. From this we can see that the both i < j and pi < pj happen only when i and j are in the middle n - 2·k cows. Therefore we know our algorithm is optimal.An O(k) solution, therefore, is to count how many incorrectly ordered pairs (i, j) are created at each step and add them up. When we swap cow i and (n + 1) - i in step i, this creates 1 + 2·(n - 2i) more pairs. So the answer will be .We can reduce this to O(1) by using our earlier observation, that every pair except those pairs are unordered, which gives total pairs (i, j). Note that this does always not fit in a 32-bit integer. Code#include<bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\ntypedef long long LL;\n\nint main(){\n\tLL n, k;\n\tcin >> n >> k;\n\tLL c = max(n-2*k,0LL);\n\tLL a = n*(n-1)/2-c*(c-1)/2;\n\tcout << a << endl;\n}645C - Enduring ExodusIdea: GlebsHPFirst, observe that the k + 1 rooms that Farmer John books should be consecutive empty rooms. Thus we can loop over all such sets of rooms with a sliding window in linear time. To check the next set of rooms, we simply advance each endpoint of our interval to the next empty room. Every time we do this, we need to compute the optimal placement of Farmer John’s room. We can maintain the position of his room with two pointers—as we slide our window of rooms to the right, the optimal position of Farmer John’s room should always move to the right or remain the same. This solution runs in O(n). Alternatively, we can use binary search or an STL set to find the best placement for Farmer John’s room as we iterate over the intervals of rooms. The complexity of these approaches is . Code#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint N, K, res = 1e9;\nstring S;\n\nint next(int i){ // finds the next empty room\n do {\n i += 1;\n } while(i < N && S[i] == '1');\n return i;\n}\n\nint main(){\n cin >> N >> K >> S;\n int l = next(-1), m = l, r = l;\n for(int i = 0; i < K; i++){ // sets up the sliding window\n r = next(r);\n }\n while(r < N){\n while(max(m - l, r - m) > max(next(m) - l, r - next(m))){\n m = next(m);\n }\n res = min(res, max(m - l, r - m));\n l = next(l);\n r = next(r);\n }\n cout << res << 'n';\n}645D - Robot Rapping Results ReportIdea: abacadaeaThe robots will become fully sorted if and only if there exists a path with n vertices in the directed graph defined by the match results. Because it is guaranteed that the results are not contradictory, this graph must be directed and acyclic—a DAG. Thus we can compute the longest path in this DAG via dynamic programming or a toposort.We now have two cases. First, if the longest path contains n vertices, then it must uniquely define the ordering of the robots. This means the answer is the time at which the last edge was added to this path. Otherwise, if the longest path has fewer than n vertices, then multiple orderings satisfy the results and you should print  - 1. Note that this algorithm runs in O(n + m).Another solution to this problem binary searches on the answer. For some k, consider only those edges that were added before time k. We can determine if the robots could be totally ordered at time k by running a toposort and checking if the longest path covers all n vertices. This might be more intuitive for some, but has a complexity of . Code#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\n\nconst int MAXN = 1000005;\nint N, M, dp[MAXN], res[MAXN];\nvector<pair<int,int>> adj[MAXN];\n\nint check(int v){\n if(dp[v]) return dp[v];\n dp[v] = 1;\n for(auto p : adj[v]){\n int n = p.first;\n if(check(n) + 1 > dp[v]){\n dp[v] = dp[n] + 1;\n res[v] = max(res[n], p.second);\n }\n }\n return dp[v];\n}\n\nint main(){\n scanf(\"%d%d\", &N, &M);\n for(int i = 0; i < M; i++){\n int a, b;\n scanf(\"%d%d\", &a, &b);\n a -= 1, b -= 1;\n adj[a].push_back({b, i + 1});\n }\n for(int i = 0; i < N; i++){\n if(check(i) == N){\n printf(\"%dn\", res[i]);\n return 0;\n }\n }\n printf(\"-1n\");\n}645E - Intellectual InquiryIdea: yummyFor simplicity, let’s represent the letters by 1, 2, ..., k instead of actual characters. Let a[i] denote the number of distinct subsequences of the string that end in the letter i. Appending the letter j to a string only changes the value of a[j]. Note that the new a[j] becomes —we can have the single letter j, or append j to any of our old subsequences.The key observation is that no matter what character j we choose to append, a[j] will always end up the same. This suggests a greedy algorithm—always appending the character j with the smallest a[j]. But how do we know which a[j] is minimal while maintaining their values modulo 109 + 7?The final observation is that if the last occurrence of j is after the last occurrence of j' in our string, then a[j] > a[j']. This is true because appending j to the string makes a[j] larger than all other a[i]. So instead of choosing the minimum a[i], we can always choose the letter that appeared least recently. Since the sequence of letters we append becomes periodic, our solution runs in . Of course, we can also find the least recently used letter with less efficient approaches, obtaining solutions with complexity O((L + n)k).

One quickly notes that it is too slow to loop over all choices of k flowers, as there could be up to choices of k species.So how can we compute a sum over terms? Well, we will definitely need to use the properties of the gcd function. If we figure out for each integer a ≤ 106 how many times occurs in the sum (let this be g(a)), then our answer will be equal to overall all a.It seems that if d(a) is the number of multiples of a in our sequence, then there are k-tuples which have gcd a. Yet there is something wrong with this reasoning: some of those k-tuples can have gcd 2a, or 3a, or any multiple of a. In fact, , the number of gcds which are a multiple of a. We will try to write as a sum of these . We’ll take an example, when a ranges from 1 to 4. The sum we wish to compute is g(1) + 2g(2) + 3g(3) + 4g(4) which can be written as (g(1) + g(2) + g(3) + g(4)) + (g(2) + g(4)) + 2(g(3)) + 2(g(4)), or In general, we want to find coefficients pi such that we can write as . Equating coefficients of g(a) on both sides, we get that . (The mathematically versed reader will note that pi = φ(i), Euler's totient function, but this is not necessary to solve the problem.)We can thus precalculate all pi in using a recursive formula: . We can also precalculate for each l ≤ 200000, so in order to output after each query we should keep track of the values of the function d(i), the number of multiples of i. When receiving ci flowers, we only need to update d for the divisors of ci and add . If we precompute the list of divisors of every integer using a sieve or sqrt checking, each update requires O(divisors).Thus the complexity of this algorithm is or preprocessing, and O((n + q)·max(divisors)).

It works as follows:First, let’s try to solve the smaller case where we only have two points. Let be the line passing through xi and xj. We want to compute the difference of relative to P and Q. Define P’ as the reflection of P over . By the triangle inequality, we have |PX - QX| = |P’X - QX| ≤ P’Q. Equality can be achieved when X, P’ and Q are collinear—that is, when X is the intersection of and line P’Q. (If and P’Q are parallel, we can imagine that they intersect at infinity.) Therefore, the difference of a line relative to P and Q is the distance from P’ to Q.We can also think about P’ in a different way. Let Ci be the circle with center xi that pases through P. Then P’ is the second intersection of the two circles Ci and Cj. Thus our problem of finding a line with minimum difference becomes equivalent to finding the intersection among {Ci} that lies closest to Q. This last part we can do with a binary search.Consider the problem of checking if two circles Ci and Cj intersect at a point within a distance r of Q. In other words, we wish to check if they intersect inside a circle S of radius r centered at Q. Let Ai and Aj be the arcs of S contained by Ci and Cj, respectively. Observe that Ci and Cj intersect inside the circle if and only if the two arcs overlap, but do not contain each other. Thus we can verify this condition for all pairs of points with a radial sweep line along the circle. Due to the binary search and the sorting necessary for the sweep line, this solution runs in , where P is the precision required.One might also wonder if precision will be an issue with all the calculations that we’re doing. It turns out that it won’t be, since our binary search will always stabilize the problem and get us very close to the answer. Here’s my original solution using a projective transformation:We begin by binary searching on the the minimum possible difference. Thus we wish to solve the decision problem \"Can a difference of k be achieved?\" Consider the hyperbola |PX - QX| = k. Note that our answer is affirmative if and only if a pair of outposts defines a line that does not intersect the hyperbola.Our next step is a reduction to an equivalent decision problem on a circle through a projective transformation. We express this transformation as the composition of two simpler operations. The first is an affine map that takes the hyperbola |PX - QX| = k to the unit hyperbola. The second maps homogenous coordinates (x, y, z) to (z, y, x). Under the latter, the unit hyperbola x2 - y2 = z2 goes to the unit circle x2 + y2 = z2.Because projective transformations preserve collinearity, a line intersecting the hyperbola is equivalent to a line intersecting the circle. Thus we want to know if any pair of the outposts' images defines a line that does not intersect the circle. We now map the image of each outpost to the minor arc on the unit circle defined by its tangents. (We disregard any points lying inside the circle.) Observe that our condition is equivalent to the existence of two intersecting arcs, neither of which contains the other. Verifying that two such arcs exist can be done with a priority queue and a radial sweep line in .The total complexity of our solution is therefore , where P is the precision that we need. It turns out that the implementation of this algorithm is actually pretty neat: Code#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\n\ntypedef long double ld;\n\nconst ld EPS = 1e-12;\nconst ld PI = acos(-1);\nconst int MAXN = 100005;\nint N;\nld A, X[MAXN], Y[MAXN];\n\nbool check(ld m){\n ld u = m / 2;\n ld v = sqrt(A * A - u * u);\n vector<pair<ld,ld>> ev;\n for(int i = 0; i < N; i++){\n ld x = 1, y = Y[i] / v, alpha;\n if(X[i] != 0){\n x *= u / X[i], y *= u / X[i];\n ld r = sqrt(x * x + y * y);\n if(r < 1) continue;\n alpha = acos(1 / r);\n } else {\n alpha = PI / 2;\n }\n ld base = atan2(y, x) - alpha;\n if(base < 0) base += 2 * PI;\n ev.push_back({base, base + 2 * alpha});\n }\n priority_queue<ld, vector<ld>, greater<ld>> pq;\n sort(ev.begin(), ev.end());\n for(int i = 0; i < 2; i++){\n for(int j = 0; j < ev.size(); j++){\n while(pq.size() && pq.top() < ev[j].first) pq.pop();\n if(pq.size() && pq.top() < ev[j].second) return 1;\n pq.push(ev[j].second);\n ev[j].first += 2 * PI;\n ev[j].second += 2 * PI;\n }\n }\n return 0;\n}\n\nint main(){\n ios::sync_with_stdio(0);\n cin >> N >> A;\n for(int i = 0; i < N; i++){\n cin >> X[i] >> Y[i];\n }\n ld lo = 0, hi = 2 * A;\n while(hi - lo > EPS){\n ld mid = (lo + hi) / 2;\n (check(mid) ? hi : lo) = mid;\n }\n cout << fixed << setprecision(10);\n cout << (lo + hi) / 2 << 'n';\n}",

          "content": "Hey Codeforces!The Elimination Round of the CROC 2016 Championship will take place on Friday, March 18 at 16:35 UTC. After our last round, Yang Liu (desert97), Michael Kural (pi37) and I realized that we haven't had enough, so we joined forces with Kevin Sun (ksun48) and Daniel Chiu (waterfalls) to prepare another problem set for you guys. Our contest will be for combined divisions and consist of seven problems. And although only those who pass the Qualification Round can participate officially, the round will be open to and rated for all Codeforces users. As always, we'll be taking the tractor to Bovinia for some farmland algorithmic adventures with Farmer John, Bessie and her best friend Elsie!Before we begin, we'd like to thank GlebsHP for doing a wonderful job as contest coordinator—we'd be hopeless without you. We would also like to thank MikeMirzayanov and the Codeforces staff for creating the awesome Codeforces and Polygon platforms. And finally, we're immensely grateful to abacadaea for providing one of the problem ideas and to winger and AlexFetisov for test solving our round.Formally, there will be two rounds on the same problem set (both rated): CROC 2016 — Elimination Round: for registered Championship participants who have passed the Qualification, CROC 2016 — Elimination Round (Rated Unofficial Edition): for all others. To take part in the official round you have to be registered for the Championship and solve at least one problem in Qualification round. Both the elimination round and its unofficial edition will be rated. The only difference is that the top 50 participants in the official round will be invited to join the Finals in Moscow. Finalists will be responsible for organizing their trip (tickets, hotel, visas and so on). Each participant may claim reimbursement for transportation expenses not exceeding ~135 USD. Invitations should be accepted no later than March 25.We hope you enjoy our problems and our cow-flavored text even more than you did last time! Good luck!UPD1: System testing is delayed because we are investigating some technical issues.UPD2: The editorial has been posted here. Thanks for participating!UPD3: Since last ~15 minutes judging system was incorrectly configured for F in the contest \"CROC 2016 — Elimination Round\" (it is interesting story how it happened), you may appeal your rating change if it affected you much. If you have submitted a solution for F in last 15 minutes and you have strong arguments why incorrect verdict (WA/RE on the test 1) significantly affected your place, please write MikeMirzayanov to make your participation unrated. Sorry about the issue. You can do it before March, 19, 23:59 (UTC).UPD4: I'd like to congratulate the winners of each round, as well as the top 50 in the Elimination Round for progressing to the CROC 2016 Championship Finals!

          "content": "645A - Amity AssessmentIdea: yummyOne solution is to just brute force and use DFS to try all the possibilities. Alternatively, note that two puzzles can be changed to each other if and only if the A, B, and C have the same orientation—clockwise or counterclockwise—in the puzzle. A third option, since the number of possibilities is so small, is to simply classify all of the 4! = 24 configurations by hand. Code#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\n\nstring b, b1, b2, e, e1, e2;\n\nint main(){\n cin >> b1 >> b2 >> e1 >> e2;\n swap(b2[0], b2[1]);\n swap(e2[0], e2[1]);\n b = b1 + b2;\n e = e1 + e2;\n b.erase(b.find('X'), 1);\n e.erase(e.find('X'), 1);\n if((b + b).find(e) != string::npos){\n\tcout << \"YESn\";\n } else {\n\tcout << \"NOn\";\n }\n}\n645B - Mischievous Mess MakersIdea: ksun48Loosely speaking, we’re trying to reverse the array as much as possible.Intuitively, the optimal solution seems to be to switch the first and last cow, then the second and second-to-last cow, and so on for k minutes, unless the sequence is reversed already, in which case we are done. But how can we show that these moves give the optimal messiness?It is clear when 2·k ≥ n - 1 that we can reverse the array with this method.However, when 2·k < n - 1, there are going to be cows that we must not have not moved a single time. Since in each move we swap at most 2 cows, there must be at least n - 2·k cows that we have not touched, with pi = i. Two untouched cows i and j must have pi < pj, so there must be at least pairs of cows which are ordered correctly.In fact, if we follow the above process, we get that pi = (n + 1) - i for the first k and last k cows, while pi = i for the middle n - 2·k cows. From this we can see that the both i < j and pi < pj happen only when i and j are in the middle n - 2·k cows. Therefore we know our algorithm is optimal.An O(k) solution, therefore, is to count how many incorrectly ordered pairs (i, j) are created at each step and add them up. When we swap cow i and (n + 1) - i in step i, this creates 1 + 2·(n - 2i) more pairs. So the answer will be .We can reduce this to O(1) by using our earlier observation, that every pair except those pairs are unordered, which gives total pairs (i, j). Note that this does always not fit in a 32-bit integer. Code#include<bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\ntypedef long long LL;\n\nint main(){\n\tLL n, k;\n\tcin >> n >> k;\n\tLL c = max(n-2*k,0LL);\n\tLL a = n*(n-1)/2-c*(c-1)/2;\n\tcout << a << endl;\n}645C - Enduring ExodusIdea: GlebsHPFirst, observe that the k + 1 rooms that Farmer John books should be consecutive empty rooms. Thus we can loop over all such sets of rooms with a sliding window in linear time. To check the next set of rooms, we simply advance each endpoint of our interval to the next empty room. Every time we do this, we need to compute the optimal placement of Farmer John’s room. We can maintain the position of his room with two pointers—as we slide our window of rooms to the right, the optimal position of Farmer John’s room should always move to the right or remain the same. This solution runs in O(n). Alternatively, we can use binary search or an STL set to find the best placement for Farmer John’s room as we iterate over the intervals of rooms. The complexity of these approaches is . Code#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint N, K, res = 1e9;\nstring S;\n\nint next(int i){ // finds the next empty room\n do {\n i += 1;\n } while(i < N && S[i] == '1');\n return i;\n}\n\nint main(){\n cin >> N >> K >> S;\n int l = next(-1), m = l, r = l;\n for(int i = 0; i < K; i++){ // sets up the sliding window\n r = next(r);\n }\n while(r < N){\n while(max(m - l, r - m) > max(next(m) - l, r - next(m))){\n m = next(m);\n }\n res = min(res, max(m - l, r - m));\n l = next(l);\n r = next(r);\n }\n cout << res << 'n';\n}645D - Robot Rapping Results ReportIdea: abacadaeaThe robots will become fully sorted if and only if there exists a path with n vertices in the directed graph defined by the match results. Because it is guaranteed that the results are not contradictory, this graph must be directed and acyclic—a DAG. Thus we can compute the longest path in this DAG via dynamic programming or a toposort.We now have two cases. First, if the longest path contains n vertices, then it must uniquely define the ordering of the robots. This means the answer is the time at which the last edge was added to this path. Otherwise, if the longest path has fewer than n vertices, then multiple orderings satisfy the results and you should print  - 1. Note that this algorithm runs in O(n + m).Another solution to this problem binary searches on the answer. For some k, consider only those edges that were added before time k. We can determine if the robots could be totally ordered at time k by running a toposort and checking if the longest path covers all n vertices. This might be more intuitive for some, but has a complexity of . Code#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\n\nconst int MAXN = 1000005;\nint N, M, dp[MAXN], res[MAXN];\nvector<pair<int,int>> adj[MAXN];\n\nint check(int v){\n if(dp[v]) return dp[v];\n dp[v] = 1;\n for(auto p : adj[v]){\n int n = p.first;\n if(check(n) + 1 > dp[v]){\n dp[v] = dp[n] + 1;\n res[v] = max(res[n], p.second);\n }\n }\n return dp[v];\n}\n\nint main(){\n scanf(\"%d%d\", &N, &M);\n for(int i = 0; i < M; i++){\n int a, b;\n scanf(\"%d%d\", &a, &b);\n a -= 1, b -= 1;\n adj[a].push_back({b, i + 1});\n }\n for(int i = 0; i < N; i++){\n if(check(i) == N){\n printf(\"%dn\", res[i]);\n return 0;\n }\n }\n printf(\"-1n\");\n}645E - Intellectual InquiryIdea: yummyFor simplicity, let’s represent the letters by 1, 2, ..., k instead of actual characters. Let a[i] denote the number of distinct subsequences of the string that end in the letter i. Appending the letter j to a string only changes the value of a[j]. Note that the new a[j] becomes —we can have the single letter j, or append j to any of our old subsequences.The key observation is that no matter what character j we choose to append, a[j] will always end up the same. This suggests a greedy algorithm—always appending the character j with the smallest a[j]. But how do we know which a[j] is minimal while maintaining their values modulo 109 + 7?The final observation is that if the last occurrence of j is after the last occurrence of j' in our string, then a[j] > a[j']. This is true because appending j to the string makes a[j] larger than all other a[i]. So instead of choosing the minimum a[i], we can always choose the letter that appeared least recently. Since the sequence of letters we append becomes periodic, our solution runs in . Of course, we can also find the least recently used letter with less efficient approaches, obtaining solutions with complexity O((L + n)k). Code#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\n\ntypedef long long ll;\n\nconst ll MOD = 1000000007;\nconst int MAXK = 26;\nint N, K, last[MAXK], ord[MAXK];\nll dp[MAXK], sum;\nstring S;\n\nbool comp(int a, int b){\n return last[a] < last[b];\n}\n\nvoid append(int c){\n sum = (sum - dp[c] + MOD) % MOD;\n dp[c] = (dp[c] + sum + 1) % MOD;\n sum = (sum + dp[c]) % MOD;\n}\n\nint main(){\n cin >> N >> K >> S;\n fill(last, last + K, -1);\n for(int i = 0; i < S.size(); i++){\n int c = S[i] - 'a';\n last[c] = i;\n append(c);\n }\n iota(ord, ord + K, 0);\n sort(ord, ord + K, comp);\n for(int i = 0; i < N; i++){\n int c = ord[i % K];\n append(c);\n }\n cout << (sum + 1) % MOD << 'n';\n}645F - Cowslip CollectionsIdea: desert97After each query, the problem is essentially asking us to compute the sum of for each choice of k flowers. One quickly notes that it is too slow to loop over all choices of k flowers, as there could be up to choices of k species.So how can we compute a sum over terms? Well, we will definitely need to use the properties of the gcd function. If we figure out for each integer a ≤ 106 how many times occurs in the sum (let this be g(a)), then our answer will be equal to overall all a.It seems that if d(a) is the number of multiples of a in our sequence, then there are k-tuples which have gcd a. Yet there is something wrong with this reasoning: some of those k-tuples can have gcd 2a, or 3a, or any multiple of a. In fact, , the number of gcds which are a multiple of a. We will try to write as a sum of these . We’ll take an example, when a ranges from 1 to 4. The sum we wish to compute is g(1) + 2g(2) + 3g(3) + 4g(4) which can be written as (g(1) + g(2) + g(3) + g(4)) + (g(2) + g(4)) + 2(g(3)) + 2(g(4)), or In general, we want to find coefficients pi such that we can write as . Equating coefficients of g(a) on both sides, we get that . (The mathematically versed reader will note that pi = φ(i), Euler's totient function, but this is not necessary to solve the problem.)We can thus precalculate all pi in using a recursive formula: . We can also precalculate for each l ≤ 200000, so in order to output after each query we should keep track of the values of the function d(i), the number of multiples of i. When receiving ci flowers, we only need to update d for the divisors of ci and add . If we precompute the list of divisors of every integer using a sieve or sqrt checking, each update requires O(divisors).Thus the complexity of this algorithm is or preprocessing, and O((n + q)·max(divisors)).

It works as follows:First, let’s try to solve the smaller case where we only have two points. Let be the line passing through xi and xj. We want to compute the difference of relative to P and Q. Define P’ as the reflection of P over . By the triangle inequality, we have |PX - QX| = |P’X - QX| ≤ P’Q. Equality can be achieved when X, P’ and Q are collinear—that is, when X is the intersection of and line P’Q. (If and P’Q are parallel, we can imagine that they intersect at infinity.) Therefore, the difference of a line relative to P and Q is the distance from P’ to Q.We can also think about P’ in a different way. Let Ci be the circle with center xi that pases through P. Then P’ is the second intersection of the two circles Ci and Cj. Thus our problem of finding a line with minimum difference becomes equivalent to finding the intersection among {Ci} that lies closest to Q. This last part we can do with a binary search.Consider the problem of checking if two circles Ci and Cj intersect at a point within a distance r of Q. In other words, we wish to check if they intersect inside a circle S of radius r centered at Q. Let Ai and Aj be the arcs of S contained by Ci and Cj, respectively. Observe that Ci and Cj intersect inside the circle if and only if the two arcs overlap, but do not contain each other. Thus we can verify this condition for all pairs of points with a radial sweep line along the circle. Due to the binary search and the sorting necessary for the sweep line, this solution runs in , where P is the precision required.One might also wonder if precision will be an issue with all the calculations that we’re doing. It turns out that it won’t be, since our binary search will always stabilize the problem and get us very close to the answer. Here’s my original solution using a projective transformation:We begin by binary searching on the the minimum possible difference. Thus we wish to solve the decision problem \"Can a difference of k be achieved?\" Consider the hyperbola |PX - QX| = k. Note that our answer is affirmative if and only if a pair of outposts defines a line that does not intersect the hyperbola.Our next step is a reduction to an equivalent decision problem on a circle through a projective transformation. We express this transformation as the composition of two simpler operations. The first is an affine map that takes the hyperbola |PX - QX| = k to the unit hyperbola. The second maps homogenous coordinates (x, y, z) to (z, y, x). Under the latter, the unit hyperbola x2 - y2 = z2 goes to the unit circle x2 + y2 = z2.Because projective transformations preserve collinearity, a line intersecting the hyperbola is equivalent to a line intersecting the circle. Thus we want to know if any pair of the outposts' images defines a line that does not intersect the circle. We now map the image of each outpost to the minor arc on the unit circle defined by its tangents. (We disregard any points lying inside the circle.) Observe that our condition is equivalent to the existence of two intersecting arcs, neither of which contains the other. Verifying that two such arcs exist can be done with a priority queue and a radial sweep line in .The total complexity of our solution is therefore , where P is the precision that we need. It turns out that the implementation of this algorithm is actually pretty neat: Code#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\n\ntypedef long double ld;\n\nconst ld EPS = 1e-12;\nconst ld PI = acos(-1);\nconst int MAXN = 100005;\nint N;\nld A, X[MAXN], Y[MAXN];\n\nbool check(ld m){\n ld u = m / 2;\n ld v = sqrt(A * A - u * u);\n vector<pair<ld,ld>> ev;\n for(int i = 0; i < N; i++){\n ld x = 1, y = Y[i] / v, alpha;\n if(X[i] != 0){\n x *= u / X[i], y *= u / X[i];\n ld r = sqrt(x * x + y * y);\n if(r < 1) continue;\n alpha = acos(1 / r);\n } else {\n alpha = PI / 2;\n }\n ld base = atan2(y, x) - alpha;\n if(base < 0) base += 2 * PI;\n ev.push_back({base, base + 2 * alpha});\n }\n priority_queue<ld, vector<ld>, greater<ld>> pq;\n sort(ev.begin(), ev.end());\n for(int i = 0; i < 2; i++){\n for(int j = 0; j < ev.size(); j++){\n while(pq.size() && pq.top() < ev[j].first) pq.pop();\n if(pq.size() && pq.top() < ev[j].second) return 1;\n pq.push(ev[j].second);\n ev[j].first += 2 * PI;\n ev[j].second += 2 * PI;\n }\n }\n return 0;\n}\n\nint main(){\n ios::sync_with_stdio(0);\n cin >> N >> A;\n for(int i = 0; i < N; i++){\n cin >> X[i] >> Y[i];\n }\n ld lo = 0, hi = 2 * A;\n while(hi - lo > EPS){\n ld mid = (lo + hi) / 2;\n (check(mid) ? hi : lo) = mid;\n }\n cout << fixed << setprecision(10);\n cout << (lo + hi) / 2 << 'n';\n}",

          "content": "Привет, Codeforces!Отборочный этап чемпионата КРОК 2016 состоится в пятницу 18-го марта в 19:35 (московское время).После нашего крайнего раунда, Yang Liu (desert97), Michael Kural (pi37) и я поняли, что мы еще не завязали с подготовкой раундов. Мы объединили усилия с Kevin Sun (ksun48) и Daniel Chiu (waterfalls) чтобы предложить еще один раунд для вас. Этот раунд будет сразу для обоих дивизионов и будет состоять из 7 задач. Те из вас, кто прошел Квалификацию и зарегистрирован на Чемпионат примут участие в официальной редакции, остальные — в неофициальной (открытой для всех). Обе редакции будут рейтинговыми. Как всегда, вас ждет путешествие на тракторе в Бовинию с фермерско-алгоритмическими приключениями в компании фермера Джона, Бесси и ее лучшего друга Элси!Перед стартом хочется поблагодарить GlebsHP за блестящую работу в роли координатора. Глеб, без тебя не было бы никакой надежды провести этот раунд! Так же наша благодарность MikeMirzayanov и всей команде Codeforces за создание клевых платформ Codeforces и Polygon. Наконец, мы безмерно благодарны abacadaea за помощь с идеями задач, а winger и AlexFetisov за прорешку раунда.Формально, будут проведены два раунда на одном и том же комплекте задач (оба раунда рейтинговые): КРОК 2016 — Отборочный Раунд: для зарегистрированных на Чемпионат участников, кто прошел Квалификацию, КРОК 2016 — Отборочный Раунд (рейтинговая неофиц. редакция): для всех остальных. Вы можете принять участие в Раунде официально, если на момент регистрации в нем вы зарегистрированы на Чемпионат и решили в Квалификации хотя бы одну задачу. Еще раз напомним, что независимо от формы участия, ваш рейтинг будет обновлен по результатам раунда. Единственная различие — в случае успешного выступления официальные лучшие 50 участников будут приглашены на Финал в Москву. Организация поездки (билеты, гостиница, виза и всё остальное) — это полностью забота финалистов. Участникам Финала КРОК-2016 будут покрыты транспортные расходы на сумму не более 10000 рублей (предполагается проезд обыкновенным купейным вагоном, либо, по согласованию, эконом-перелет самолетом). До 25-го марта необходимо будет подтвердить желание и возможность принять участие в Финале. Участники Финала будут бороться за призы: 1 место — 100000 рублей 2 местo — 70000 рублей 3 местo — 50000 рублей Мы еще обновим пост информацией о разбалловке. Надеемся, что вам понравятся задачи и наши коровоориентированные тексты. Удачи!UPD3: Так как примерно 15 последних минут соревнования тестирующая система некорректно обрабатывала попытки по F в раунде \"КРОК 2016 — Отборочный Раунд\" (и это отдельная интересная история как так вышло), вы можете обжаловать ваше изменение рейтинга, если влияние этого инцидента на ваш результат велико. Если вы отсылали F в последние 15 минут и имеете веские аргументы почему некорректный вердикт (WA/RE на тесте 1) сильно повлиял на ваше место, то напишите MikeMirzayanov и ваше участие можно будет сделать нерейтинговым. Приносим извинения за эту накладку. Апелляцию надо написать до 02:59 20-го марта (московское время).",

          "content": "645A - Amity AssessmentIdea: yummyOne solution is to just brute force and use DFS to try all the possibilities. Alternatively, note that two puzzles can be changed to each other if and only if the A, B, and C have the same orientation—clockwise or counterclockwise—in the puzzle. A third option, since the number of possibilities is so small, is to simply classify all of the 4! = 24 configurations by hand.

But how can we show that these moves give the optimal messiness?It is clear when 2·k ≥ n - 1 that we can reverse the array with this method.However, when 2·k < n - 1, there are going to be cows that we must not have not moved a single time. Since in each move we swap at most 2 cows, there must be at least n - 2·k cows that we have not touched, with pi = i. Two untouched cows i and j must have pi < pj, so there must be at least pairs of cows which are ordered correctly.In fact, if we follow the above process, we get that pi = (n + 1) - i for the first k and last k cows, while pi = i for the middle n - 2·k cows. From this we can see that the both i < j and pi < pj happen only when i and j are in the middle n - 2·k cows. Therefore we know our algorithm is optimal.An O(k) solution, therefore, is to count how many incorrectly ordered pairs (i, j) are created at each step and add them up. When we swap cow i and (n + 1) - i in step i, this creates 1 + 2·(n - 2i) more pairs. So the answer will be .We can reduce this to O(1) by using our earlier observation, that every pair except those pairs are unordered, which gives total pairs (i, j). Note that this does always not fit in a 32-bit integer.

Thus we can loop over all such sets of rooms with a sliding window in linear time. To check the next set of rooms, we simply advance each endpoint of our interval to the next empty room. Every time we do this, we need to compute the optimal placement of Farmer John’s room. We can maintain the position of his room with two pointers—as we slide our window of rooms to the right, the optimal position of Farmer John’s room should always move to the right or remain the same. This solution runs in O(n). Alternatively, we can use binary search or an STL set to find the best placement for Farmer John’s room as we iterate over the intervals of rooms. The complexity of these approaches is . Code#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint N, K, res = 1e9;\nstring S;\n\nint next(int i){ // finds the next empty room\n do {\n i += 1;\n } while(i < N && S[i] == '1');\n return i;\n}\n\nint main(){\n cin >> N >> K >> S;\n int l = next(-1), m = l, r = l;\n for(int i = 0; i < K; i++){ // sets up the sliding window\n r = next(r);\n }\n while(r < N){\n while(max(m - l, r - m) > max(next(m) - l, r - next(m))){\n m = next(m);\n }\n res = min(res, max(m - l, r - m));\n l = next(l);\n r = next(r);\n }\n cout << res << 'n';\n}645D - Robot Rapping Results ReportIdea: abacadaeaThe robots will become fully sorted if and only if there exists a path with n vertices in the directed graph defined by the match results. Because it is guaranteed that the results are not contradictory, this graph must be directed and acyclic—a DAG. Thus we can compute the longest path in this DAG via dynamic programming or a toposort.We now have two cases. First, if the longest path contains n vertices, then it must uniquely define the ordering of the robots. This means the answer is the time at which the last edge was added to this path. Otherwise, if the longest path has fewer than n vertices, then multiple orderings satisfy the results and you should print  - 1. Note that this algorithm runs in O(n + m).Another solution to this problem binary searches on the answer. For some k, consider only those edges that were added before time k. We can determine if the robots could be totally ordered at time k by running a toposort and checking if the longest path covers all n vertices. This might be more intuitive for some, but has a complexity of .

Let a[i] denote the number of distinct subsequences of the string that end in the letter i. Appending the letter j to a string only changes the value of a[j]. Note that the new a[j] becomes —we can have the single letter j, or append j to any of our old subsequences.The key observation is that no matter what character j we choose to append, a[j] will always end up the same. This suggests a greedy algorithm—always appending the character j with the smallest a[j]. But how do we know which a[j] is minimal while maintaining their values modulo 109 + 7?The final observation is that if the last occurrence of j is after the last occurrence of j' in our string, then a[j] > a[j']. This is true because appending j to the string makes a[j] larger than all other a[i]. So instead of choosing the minimum a[i], we can always choose the letter that appeared least recently. Since the sequence of letters we append becomes periodic, our solution runs in . Of course, we can also find the least recently used letter with less efficient approaches, obtaining solutions with complexity O((L + n)k).

One quickly notes that it is too slow to loop over all choices of k flowers, as there could be up to choices of k species.So how can we compute a sum over terms? Well, we will definitely need to use the properties of the gcd function. If we figure out for each integer a ≤ 106 how many times occurs in the sum (let this be g(a)), then our answer will be equal to overall all a.It seems that if d(a) is the number of multiples of a in our sequence, then there are k-tuples which have gcd a. Yet there is something wrong with this reasoning: some of those k-tuples can have gcd 2a, or 3a, or any multiple of a. In fact, , the number of gcds which are a multiple of a. We will try to write as a sum of these . We’ll take an example, when a ranges from 1 to 4. The sum we wish to compute is g(1) + 2g(2) + 3g(3) + 4g(4) which can be written as (g(1) + g(2) + g(3) + g(4)) + (g(2) + g(4)) + 2(g(3)) + 2(g(4)), or In general, we want to find coefficients pi such that we can write as . Equating coefficients of g(a) on both sides, we get that . (The mathematically versed reader will note that pi = φ(i), Euler's totient function, but this is not necessary to solve the problem.)We can thus precalculate all pi in using a recursive formula: . We can also precalculate for each l ≤ 200000, so in order to output after each query we should keep track of the values of the function d(i), the number of multiples of i. When receiving ci flowers, we only need to update d for the divisors of ci and add . If we precompute the list of divisors of every integer using a sieve or sqrt checking, each update requires O(divisors).Thus the complexity of this algorithm is or preprocessing, and O((n + q)·max(divisors)).

It works as follows:First, let’s try to solve the smaller case where we only have two points. Let be the line passing through xi and xj. We want to compute the difference of relative to P and Q. Define P’ as the reflection of P over . By the triangle inequality, we have |PX - QX| = |P’X - QX| ≤ P’Q. Equality can be achieved when X, P’ and Q are collinear—that is, when X is the intersection of and line P’Q. (If and P’Q are parallel, we can imagine that they intersect at infinity.) Therefore, the difference of a line relative to P and Q is the distance from P’ to Q.We can also think about P’ in a different way. Let Ci be the circle with center xi that pases through P. Then P’ is the second intersection of the two circles Ci and Cj. Thus our problem of finding a line with minimum difference becomes equivalent to finding the intersection among {Ci} that lies closest to Q. This last part we can do with a binary search.Consider the problem of checking if two circles Ci and Cj intersect at a point within a distance r of Q. In other words, we wish to check if they intersect inside a circle S of radius r centered at Q. Let Ai and Aj be the arcs of S contained by Ci and Cj, respectively. Observe that Ci and Cj intersect inside the circle if and only if the two arcs overlap, but do not contain each other. Thus we can verify this condition for all pairs of points with a radial sweep line along the circle. Due to the binary search and the sorting necessary for the sweep line, this solution runs in , where P is the precision required.One might also wonder if precision will be an issue with all the calculations that we’re doing. It turns out that it won’t be, since our binary search will always stabilize the problem and get us very close to the answer. Here’s my original solution using a projective transformation:We begin by binary searching on the the minimum possible difference. Thus we wish to solve the decision problem \"Can a difference of k be achieved?\" Consider the hyperbola |PX - QX| = k. Note that our answer is affirmative if and only if a pair of outposts defines a line that does not intersect the hyperbola.Our next step is a reduction to an equivalent decision problem on a circle through a projective transformation. We express this transformation as the composition of two simpler operations. The first is an affine map that takes the hyperbola |PX - QX| = k to the unit hyperbola. The second maps homogenous coordinates (x, y, z) to (z, y, x). Under the latter, the unit hyperbola x2 - y2 = z2 goes to the unit circle x2 + y2 = z2.Because projective transformations preserve collinearity, a line intersecting the hyperbola is equivalent to a line intersecting the circle. Thus we want to know if any pair of the outposts' images defines a line that does not intersect the circle. We now map the image of each outpost to the minor arc on the unit circle defined by its tangents. (We disregard any points lying inside the circle.) Observe that our condition is equivalent to the existence of two intersecting arcs, neither of which contains the other. Verifying that two such arcs exist can be done with a priority queue and a radial sweep line in .The total complexity of our solution is therefore , where P is the precision that we need. It turns out that the implementation of this algorithm is actually pretty neat: Code#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\n\ntypedef long double ld;\n\nconst ld EPS = 1e-12;\nconst ld PI = acos(-1);\nconst int MAXN = 100005;\nint N;\nld A, X[MAXN], Y[MAXN];\n\nbool check(ld m){\n ld u = m / 2;\n ld v = sqrt(A * A - u * u);\n vector<pair<ld,ld>> ev;\n for(int i = 0; i < N; i++){\n ld x = 1, y = Y[i] / v, alpha;\n if(X[i] != 0){\n x *= u / X[i], y *= u / X[i];\n ld r = sqrt(x * x + y * y);\n if(r < 1) continue;\n alpha = acos(1 / r);\n } else {\n alpha = PI / 2;\n }\n ld base = atan2(y, x) - alpha;\n if(base < 0) base += 2 * PI;\n ev.push_back({base, base + 2 * alpha});\n }\n priority_queue<ld, vector<ld>, greater<ld>> pq;\n sort(ev.begin(), ev.end());\n for(int i = 0; i < 2; i++){\n for(int j = 0; j < ev.size(); j++){\n while(pq.size() && pq.top() < ev[j].first) pq.pop();\n if(pq.size() && pq.top() < ev[j].second) return 1;\n pq.push(ev[j].second);\n ev[j].first += 2 * PI;\n ev[j].second += 2 * PI;\n }\n }\n return 0;\n}\n\nint main(){\n ios::sync_with_stdio(0);\n cin >> N >> A;\n for(int i = 0; i < N; i++){\n cin >> X[i] >> Y[i];\n }\n ld lo = 0, hi = 2 * A;\n while(hi - lo > EPS){\n ld mid = (lo + hi) / 2;\n (check(mid) ? hi : lo) = mid;\n }\n cout << fixed << setprecision(10);\n cout << (lo + hi) / 2 << 'n';\n}",

          "content": "Hey Codeforces!The Elimination Round of the CROC 2016 Championship will take place on Friday, March 18 at 16:35 UTC. After our last round, Yang Liu (desert97), Michael Kural (pi37) and I realized that we haven't had enough, so we joined forces with Kevin Sun (ksun48) and Daniel Chiu (waterfalls) to prepare another problem set for you guys. Our contest will be for combined divisions and consist of seven problems. And although only those who pass the Qualification Round can participate officially, the round will be open to and rated for all Codeforces users. As always, we'll be taking the tractor to Bovinia for some farmland algorithmic adventures with Farmer John, Bessie and her best friend Elsie!Before we begin, we'd like to thank GlebsHP for doing a wonderful job as contest coordinator—we'd be hopeless without you. We would also like to thank MikeMirzayanov and the Codeforces staff for creating the awesome Codeforces and Polygon platforms. And finally, we're immensely grateful to abacadaea for providing one of the problem ideas and to winger and AlexFetisov for test solving our round.Formally, there will be two rounds on the same problem set (both rated): CROC 2016 — Elimination Round: for registered Championship participants who have passed the Qualification, CROC 2016 — Elimination Round (Rated Unofficial Edition): for all others. To take part in the official round you have to be registered for the Championship and solve at least one problem in Qualification round. Both the elimination round and its unofficial edition will be rated. The only difference is that the top 50 participants in the official round will be invited to join the Finals in Moscow. Finalists will be responsible for organizing their trip (tickets, hotel, visas and so on). Each participant may claim reimbursement for transportation expenses not exceeding ~135 USD. Invitations should be accepted no later than March 25.We hope you enjoy our problems and our cow-flavored text even more than you did last time! Good luck!UPD1: System testing is delayed because we are investigating some technical issues.UPD2: The editorial has been posted here. Thanks for participating!UPD3: Since last ~15 minutes judging system was incorrectly configured for F in the contest \"CROC 2016 — Elimination Round\" (it is interesting story how it happened), you may appeal your rating change if it affected you much. If you have submitted a solution for F in last 15 minutes and you have strong arguments why incorrect verdict (WA/RE on the test 1) significantly affected your place, please write MikeMirzayanov to make your participation unrated. Sorry about the issue. You can do it before March, 19, 23:59 (UTC).UPD4: I'd like to congratulate the winners of each round, as well as the top 50 in the Elimination Round for progressing to the CROC 2016 Championship Finals!

          "content": "645A - Amity AssessmentIdea: yummyOne solution is to just brute force and use DFS to try all the possibilities. Alternatively, note that two puzzles can be changed to each other if and only if the A, B, and C have the same orientation—clockwise or counterclockwise—in the puzzle. A third option, since the number of possibilities is so small, is to simply classify all of the 4! = 24 configurations by hand. Code#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\n\nstring b, b1, b2, e, e1, e2;\n\nint main(){\n cin >> b1 >> b2 >> e1 >> e2;\n swap(b2[0], b2[1]);\n swap(e2[0], e2[1]);\n b = b1 + b2;\n e = e1 + e2;\n b.erase(b.find('X'), 1);\n e.erase(e.find('X'), 1);\n if((b + b).find(e) != string::npos){\n\tcout << \"YESn\";\n } else {\n\tcout << \"NOn\";\n }\n}\n645B - Mischievous Mess MakersIdea: ksun48Loosely speaking, we’re trying to reverse the array as much as possible.Intuitively, the optimal solution seems to be to switch the first and last cow, then the second and second-to-last cow, and so on for k minutes, unless the sequence is reversed already, in which case we are done. But how can we show that these moves give the optimal messiness?It is clear when 2·k ≥ n - 1 that we can reverse the array with this method.However, when 2·k < n - 1, there are going to be cows that we must not have not moved a single time. Since in each move we swap at most 2 cows, there must be at least n - 2·k cows that we have not touched, with pi = i. Two untouched cows i and j must have pi < pj, so there must be at least pairs of cows which are ordered correctly.In fact, if we follow the above process, we get that pi = (n + 1) - i for the first k and last k cows, while pi = i for the middle n - 2·k cows. From this we can see that the both i < j and pi < pj happen only when i and j are in the middle n - 2·k cows. Therefore we know our algorithm is optimal.An O(k) solution, therefore, is to count how many incorrectly ordered pairs (i, j) are created at each step and add them up. When we swap cow i and (n + 1) - i in step i, this creates 1 + 2·(n - 2i) more pairs. So the answer will be .We can reduce this to O(1) by using our earlier observation, that every pair except those pairs are unordered, which gives total pairs (i, j). Note that this does always not fit in a 32-bit integer. Code#include<bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\ntypedef long long LL;\n\nint main(){\n\tLL n, k;\n\tcin >> n >> k;\n\tLL c = max(n-2*k,0LL);\n\tLL a = n*(n-1)/2-c*(c-1)/2;\n\tcout << a << endl;\n}645C - Enduring ExodusIdea: GlebsHPFirst, observe that the k + 1 rooms that Farmer John books should be consecutive empty rooms. Thus we can loop over all such sets of rooms with a sliding window in linear time. To check the next set of rooms, we simply advance each endpoint of our interval to the next empty room. Every time we do this, we need to compute the optimal placement of Farmer John’s room. We can maintain the position of his room with two pointers—as we slide our window of rooms to the right, the optimal position of Farmer John’s room should always move to the right or remain the same. This solution runs in O(n). Alternatively, we can use binary search or an STL set to find the best placement for Farmer John’s room as we iterate over the intervals of rooms. The complexity of these approaches is . Code#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint N, K, res = 1e9;\nstring S;\n\nint next(int i){ // finds the next empty room\n do {\n i += 1;\n } while(i < N && S[i] == '1');\n return i;\n}\n\nint main(){\n cin >> N >> K >> S;\n int l = next(-1), m = l, r = l;\n for(int i = 0; i < K; i++){ // sets up the sliding window\n r = next(r);\n }\n while(r < N){\n while(max(m - l, r - m) > max(next(m) - l, r - next(m))){\n m = next(m);\n }\n res = min(res, max(m - l, r - m));\n l = next(l);\n r = next(r);\n }\n cout << res << 'n';\n}645D - Robot Rapping Results ReportIdea: abacadaeaThe robots will become fully sorted if and only if there exists a path with n vertices in the directed graph defined by the match results. Because it is guaranteed that the results are not contradictory, this graph must be directed and acyclic—a DAG. Thus we can compute the longest path in this DAG via dynamic programming or a toposort.We now have two cases. First, if the longest path contains n vertices, then it must uniquely define the ordering of the robots. This means the answer is the time at which the last edge was added to this path. Otherwise, if the longest path has fewer than n vertices, then multiple orderings satisfy the results and you should print  - 1. Note that this algorithm runs in O(n + m).Another solution to this problem binary searches on the answer. For some k, consider only those edges that were added before time k. We can determine if the robots could be totally ordered at time k by running a toposort and checking if the longest path covers all n vertices. This might be more intuitive for some, but has a complexity of .

Let a[i] denote the number of distinct subsequences of the string that end in the letter i. Appending the letter j to a string only changes the value of a[j]. Note that the new a[j] becomes —we can have the single letter j, or append j to any of our old subsequences.The key observation is that no matter what character j we choose to append, a[j] will always end up the same. This suggests a greedy algorithm—always appending the character j with the smallest a[j]. But how do we know which a[j] is minimal while maintaining their values modulo 109 + 7?The final observation is that if the last occurrence of j is after the last occurrence of j' in our string, then a[j] > a[j']. This is true because appending j to the string makes a[j] larger than all other a[i]. So instead of choosing the minimum a[i], we can always choose the letter that appeared least recently. Since the sequence of letters we append becomes periodic, our solution runs in . Of course, we can also find the least recently used letter with less efficient approaches, obtaining solutions with complexity O((L + n)k).

One quickly notes that it is too slow to loop over all choices of k flowers, as there could be up to choices of k species.So how can we compute a sum over terms? Well, we will definitely need to use the properties of the gcd function. If we figure out for each integer a ≤ 106 how many times occurs in the sum (let this be g(a)), then our answer will be equal to overall all a.It seems that if d(a) is the number of multiples of a in our sequence, then there are k-tuples which have gcd a. Yet there is something wrong with this reasoning: some of those k-tuples can have gcd 2a, or 3a, or any multiple of a. In fact, , the number of gcds which are a multiple of a. We will try to write as a sum of these . We’ll take an example, when a ranges from 1 to 4. The sum we wish to compute is g(1) + 2g(2) + 3g(3) + 4g(4) which can be written as (g(1) + g(2) + g(3) + g(4)) + (g(2) + g(4)) + 2(g(3)) + 2(g(4)), or In general, we want to find coefficients pi such that we can write as . Equating coefficients of g(a) on both sides, we get that . (The mathematically versed reader will note that pi = φ(i), Euler's totient function, but this is not necessary to solve the problem.)We can thus precalculate all pi in using a recursive formula: . We can also precalculate for each l ≤ 200000, so in order to output after each query we should keep track of the values of the function d(i), the number of multiples of i. When receiving ci flowers, we only need to update d for the divisors of ci and add . If we precompute the list of divisors of every integer using a sieve or sqrt checking, each update requires O(divisors).Thus the complexity of this algorithm is or preprocessing, and O((n + q)·max(divisors)).

It works as follows:First, let’s try to solve the smaller case where we only have two points. Let be the line passing through xi and xj. We want to compute the difference of relative to P and Q. Define P’ as the reflection of P over . By the triangle inequality, we have |PX - QX| = |P’X - QX| ≤ P’Q. Equality can be achieved when X, P’ and Q are collinear—that is, when X is the intersection of and line P’Q. (If and P’Q are parallel, we can imagine that they intersect at infinity.) Therefore, the difference of a line relative to P and Q is the distance from P’ to Q.We can also think about P’ in a different way. Let Ci be the circle with center xi that pases through P. Then P’ is the second intersection of the two circles Ci and Cj. Thus our problem of finding a line with minimum difference becomes equivalent to finding the intersection among {Ci} that lies closest to Q. This last part we can do with a binary search.Consider the problem of checking if two circles Ci and Cj intersect at a point within a distance r of Q. In other words, we wish to check if they intersect inside a circle S of radius r centered at Q. Let Ai and Aj be the arcs of S contained by Ci and Cj, respectively. Observe that Ci and Cj intersect inside the circle if and only if the two arcs overlap, but do not contain each other. Thus we can verify this condition for all pairs of points with a radial sweep line along the circle. Due to the binary search and the sorting necessary for the sweep line, this solution runs in , where P is the precision required.One might also wonder if precision will be an issue with all the calculations that we’re doing. It turns out that it won’t be, since our binary search will always stabilize the problem and get us very close to the answer. Here’s my original solution using a projective transformation:We begin by binary searching on the the minimum possible difference. Thus we wish to solve the decision problem \"Can a difference of k be achieved?\" Consider the hyperbola |PX - QX| = k. Note that our answer is affirmative if and only if a pair of outposts defines a line that does not intersect the hyperbola.Our next step is a reduction to an equivalent decision problem on a circle through a projective transformation. We express this transformation as the composition of two simpler operations. The first is an affine map that takes the hyperbola |PX - QX| = k to the unit hyperbola. The second maps homogenous coordinates (x, y, z) to (z, y, x). Under the latter, the unit hyperbola x2 - y2 = z2 goes to the unit circle x2 + y2 = z2.Because projective transformations preserve collinearity, a line intersecting the hyperbola is equivalent to a line intersecting the circle. Thus we want to know if any pair of the outposts' images defines a line that does not intersect the circle. We now map the image of each outpost to the minor arc on the unit circle defined by its tangents. (We disregard any points lying inside the circle.) Observe that our condition is equivalent to the existence of two intersecting arcs, neither of which contains the other. Verifying that two such arcs exist can be done with a priority queue and a radial sweep line in .The total complexity of our solution is therefore , where P is the precision that we need. It turns out that the implementation of this algorithm is actually pretty neat: Code#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\n\ntypedef long double ld;\n\nconst ld EPS = 1e-12;\nconst ld PI = acos(-1);\nconst int MAXN = 100005;\nint N;\nld A, X[MAXN], Y[MAXN];\n\nbool check(ld m){\n ld u = m / 2;\n ld v = sqrt(A * A - u * u);\n vector<pair<ld,ld>> ev;\n for(int i = 0; i < N; i++){\n ld x = 1, y = Y[i] / v, alpha;\n if(X[i] != 0){\n x *= u / X[i], y *= u / X[i];\n ld r = sqrt(x * x + y * y);\n if(r < 1) continue;\n alpha = acos(1 / r);\n } else {\n alpha = PI / 2;\n }\n ld base = atan2(y, x) - alpha;\n if(base < 0) base += 2 * PI;\n ev.push_back({base, base + 2 * alpha});\n }\n priority_queue<ld, vector<ld>, greater<ld>> pq;\n sort(ev.begin(), ev.end());\n for(int i = 0; i < 2; i++){\n for(int j = 0; j < ev.size(); j++){\n while(pq.size() && pq.top() < ev[j].first) pq.pop();\n if(pq.size() && pq.top() < ev[j].second) return 1;\n pq.push(ev[j].second);\n ev[j].first += 2 * PI;\n ev[j].second += 2 * PI;\n }\n }\n return 0;\n}\n\nint main(){\n ios::sync_with_stdio(0);\n cin >> N >> A;\n for(int i = 0; i < N; i++){\n cin >> X[i] >> Y[i];\n }\n ld lo = 0, hi = 2 * A;\n while(hi - lo > EPS){\n ld mid = (lo + hi) / 2;\n (check(mid) ? hi : lo) = mid;\n }\n cout << fixed << setprecision(10);\n cout << (lo + hi) / 2 << 'n';\n}",

          "content": "Hey Codeforces!The Elimination Round of the CROC 2016 Championship will take place on Friday, March 18 at 16:35 UTC. After our last round, Yang Liu (desert97), Michael Kural (pi37) and I realized that we haven't had enough, so we joined forces with Kevin Sun (ksun48) and Daniel Chiu (waterfalls) to prepare another problem set for you guys. Our contest will be for combined divisions and consist of seven problems. And although only those who pass the Qualification Round can participate officially, the round will be open to and rated for all Codeforces users. As always, we'll be taking the tractor to Bovinia for some farmland algorithmic adventures with Farmer John, Bessie and her best friend Elsie!Before we begin, we'd like to thank GlebsHP for doing a wonderful job as contest coordinator—we'd be hopeless without you. We would also like to thank MikeMirzayanov and the Codeforces staff for creating the awesome Codeforces and Polygon platforms. And finally, we're immensely grateful to abacadaea for providing one of the problem ideas and to winger and AlexFetisov for test solving our round.Formally, there will be two rounds on the same problem set (both rated): CROC 2016 — Elimination Round: for registered Championship participants who have passed the Qualification, CROC 2016 — Elimination Round (Rated Unofficial Edition): for all others. To take part in the official round you have to be registered for the Championship and solve at least one problem in Qualification round. Both the elimination round and its unofficial edition will be rated. The only difference is that the top 50 participants in the official round will be invited to join the Finals in Moscow. Finalists will be responsible for organizing their trip (tickets, hotel, visas and so on). Each participant may claim reimbursement for transportation expenses not exceeding ~135 USD. Invitations should be accepted no later than March 25.We hope you enjoy our problems and our cow-flavored text even more than you did last time! Good luck!UPD1: System testing is delayed because we are investigating some technical issues.UPD2: The editorial has been posted here. Thanks for participating!UPD3: Since last ~15 minutes judging system was incorrectly configured for F in the contest \"CROC 2016 — Elimination Round\" (it is interesting story how it happened), you may appeal your rating change if it affected you much. If you have submitted a solution for F in last 15 minutes and you have strong arguments why incorrect verdict (WA/RE on the test 1) significantly affected your place, please write MikeMirzayanov to make your participation unrated. Sorry about the issue. You can do it before March, 19, 23:59 (UTC).UPD4: I'd like to congratulate the winners of each round, as well as the top 50 in the Elimination Round for progressing to the CROC 2016 Championship Finals!

          "content": "645A - Amity AssessmentIdea: yummyOne solution is to just brute force and use DFS to try all the possibilities. Alternatively, note that two puzzles can be changed to each other if and only if the A, B, and C have the same orientation—clockwise or counterclockwise—in the puzzle. A third option, since the number of possibilities is so small, is to simply classify all of the 4! = 24 configurations by hand. Code#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\n\nstring b, b1, b2, e, e1, e2;\n\nint main(){\n cin >> b1 >> b2 >> e1 >> e2;\n swap(b2[0], b2[1]);\n swap(e2[0], e2[1]);\n b = b1 + b2;\n e = e1 + e2;\n b.erase(b.find('X'), 1);\n e.erase(e.find('X'), 1);\n if((b + b).find(e) != string::npos){\n\tcout << \"YESn\";\n } else {\n\tcout << \"NOn\";\n }\n}\n645B - Mischievous Mess MakersIdea: ksun48Loosely speaking, we’re trying to reverse the array as much as possible.Intuitively, the optimal solution seems to be to switch the first and last cow, then the second and second-to-last cow, and so on for k minutes, unless the sequence is reversed already, in which case we are done. But how can we show that these moves give the optimal messiness?It is clear when 2·k ≥ n - 1 that we can reverse the array with this method.However, when 2·k < n - 1, there are going to be cows that we must not have not moved a single time. Since in each move we swap at most 2 cows, there must be at least n - 2·k cows that we have not touched, with pi = i. Two untouched cows i and j must have pi < pj, so there must be at least pairs of cows which are ordered correctly.In fact, if we follow the above process, we get that pi = (n + 1) - i for the first k and last k cows, while pi = i for the middle n - 2·k cows. From this we can see that the both i < j and pi < pj happen only when i and j are in the middle n - 2·k cows. Therefore we know our algorithm is optimal.An O(k) solution, therefore, is to count how many incorrectly ordered pairs (i, j) are created at each step and add them up. When we swap cow i and (n + 1) - i in step i, this creates 1 + 2·(n - 2i) more pairs. So the answer will be .We can reduce this to O(1) by using our earlier observation, that every pair except those pairs are unordered, which gives total pairs (i, j). Note that this does always not fit in a 32-bit integer. Code#include<bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\ntypedef long long LL;\n\nint main(){\n\tLL n, k;\n\tcin >> n >> k;\n\tLL c = max(n-2*k,0LL);\n\tLL a = n*(n-1)/2-c*(c-1)/2;\n\tcout << a << endl;\n}645C - Enduring ExodusIdea: GlebsHPFirst, observe that the k + 1 rooms that Farmer John books should be consecutive empty rooms. Thus we can loop over all such sets of rooms with a sliding window in linear time. To check the next set of rooms, we simply advance each endpoint of our interval to the next empty room. Every time we do this, we need to compute the optimal placement of Farmer John’s room. We can maintain the position of his room with two pointers—as we slide our window of rooms to the right, the optimal position of Farmer John’s room should always move to the right or remain the same. This solution runs in O(n). Alternatively, we can use binary search or an STL set to find the best placement for Farmer John’s room as we iterate over the intervals of rooms. The complexity of these approaches is . Code#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint N, K, res = 1e9;\nstring S;\n\nint next(int i){ // finds the next empty room\n do {\n i += 1;\n } while(i < N && S[i] == '1');\n return i;\n}\n\nint main(){\n cin >> N >> K >> S;\n int l = next(-1), m = l, r = l;\n for(int i = 0; i < K; i++){ // sets up the sliding window\n r = next(r);\n }\n while(r < N){\n while(max(m - l, r - m) > max(next(m) - l, r - next(m))){\n m = next(m);\n }\n res = min(res, max(m - l, r - m));\n l = next(l);\n r = next(r);\n }\n cout << res << 'n';\n}645D - Robot Rapping Results ReportIdea: abacadaeaThe robots will become fully sorted if and only if there exists a path with n vertices in the directed graph defined by the match results. Because it is guaranteed that the results are not contradictory, this graph must be directed and acyclic—a DAG. Thus we can compute the longest path in this DAG via dynamic programming or a toposort.We now have two cases. First, if the longest path contains n vertices, then it must uniquely define the ordering of the robots. This means the answer is the time at which the last edge was added to this path. Otherwise, if the longest path has fewer than n vertices, then multiple orderings satisfy the results and you should print  - 1. Note that this algorithm runs in O(n + m).Another solution to this problem binary searches on the answer. For some k, consider only those edges that were added before time k. We can determine if the robots could be totally ordered at time k by running a toposort and checking if the longest path covers all n vertices. This might be more intuitive for some, but has a complexity of . Code#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\n\nconst int MAXN = 1000005;\nint N, M, dp[MAXN], res[MAXN];\nvector<pair<int,int>> adj[MAXN];\n\nint check(int v){\n if(dp[v]) return dp[v];\n dp[v] = 1;\n for(auto p : adj[v]){\n int n = p.first;\n if(check(n) + 1 > dp[v]){\n dp[v] = dp[n] + 1;\n res[v] = max(res[n], p.second);\n }\n }\n return dp[v];\n}\n\nint main(){\n scanf(\"%d%d\", &N, &M);\n for(int i = 0; i < M; i++){\n int a, b;\n scanf(\"%d%d\", &a, &b);\n a -= 1, b -= 1;\n adj[a].push_back({b, i + 1});\n }\n for(int i = 0; i < N; i++){\n if(check(i) == N){\n printf(\"%dn\", res[i]);\n return 0;\n }\n }\n printf(\"-1n\");\n}645E - Intellectual InquiryIdea: yummyFor simplicity, let’s represent the letters by 1, 2, ..., k instead of actual characters. Let a[i] denote the number of distinct subsequences of the string that end in the letter i. Appending the letter j to a string only changes the value of a[j]. Note that the new a[j] becomes —we can have the single letter j, or append j to any of our old subsequences.The key observation is that no matter what character j we choose to append, a[j] will always end up the same. This suggests a greedy algorithm—always appending the character j with the smallest a[j]. But how do we know which a[j] is minimal while maintaining their values modulo 109 + 7?The final observation is that if the last occurrence of j is after the last occurrence of j' in our string, then a[j] > a[j']. This is true because appending j to the string makes a[j] larger than all other a[i]. So instead of choosing the minimum a[i], we can always choose the letter that appeared least recently. Since the sequence of letters we append becomes periodic, our solution runs in . Of course, we can also find the least recently used letter with less efficient approaches, obtaining solutions with complexity O((L + n)k). Code#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\n\ntypedef long long ll;\n\nconst ll MOD = 1000000007;\nconst int MAXK = 26;\nint N, K, last[MAXK], ord[MAXK];\nll dp[MAXK], sum;\nstring S;\n\nbool comp(int a, int b){\n return last[a] < last[b];\n}\n\nvoid append(int c){\n sum = (sum - dp[c] + MOD) % MOD;\n dp[c] = (dp[c] + sum + 1) % MOD;\n sum = (sum + dp[c]) % MOD;\n}\n\nint main(){\n cin >> N >> K >> S;\n fill(last, last + K, -1);\n for(int i = 0; i < S.size(); i++){\n int c = S[i] - 'a';\n last[c] = i;\n append(c);\n }\n iota(ord, ord + K, 0);\n sort(ord, ord + K, comp);\n for(int i = 0; i < N; i++){\n int c = ord[i % K];\n append(c);\n }\n cout << (sum + 1) % MOD << 'n';\n}645F - Cowslip CollectionsIdea: desert97After each query, the problem is essentially asking us to compute the sum of for each choice of k flowers. One quickly notes that it is too slow to loop over all choices of k flowers, as there could be up to choices of k species.So how can we compute a sum over terms? Well, we will definitely need to use the properties of the gcd function. If we figure out for each integer a ≤ 106 how many times occurs in the sum (let this be g(a)), then our answer will be equal to overall all a.It seems that if d(a) is the number of multiples of a in our sequence, then there are k-tuples which have gcd a. Yet there is something wrong with this reasoning: some of those k-tuples can have gcd 2a, or 3a, or any multiple of a. In fact, , the number of gcds which are a multiple of a. We will try to write as a sum of these . We’ll take an example, when a ranges from 1 to 4. The sum we wish to compute is g(1) + 2g(2) + 3g(3) + 4g(4) which can be written as (g(1) + g(2) + g(3) + g(4)) + (g(2) + g(4)) + 2(g(3)) + 2(g(4)), or In general, we want to find coefficients pi such that we can write as . Equating coefficients of g(a) on both sides, we get that . (The mathematically versed reader will note that pi = φ(i), Euler's totient function, but this is not necessary to solve the problem.)We can thus precalculate all pi in using a recursive formula: . We can also precalculate for each l ≤ 200000, so in order to output after each query we should keep track of the values of the function d(i), the number of multiples of i. When receiving ci flowers, we only need to update d for the divisors of ci and add . If we precompute the list of divisors of every integer using a sieve or sqrt checking, each update requires O(divisors).Thus the complexity of this algorithm is or preprocessing, and O((n + q)·max(divisors)). Code#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\n\ntypedef long long ll;\n\nconst ll MOD = 1000000007;\nconst int MAXN = 200005;\nconst int MAXA = 1000005;\nint N, K, Q, A[MAXN];\nint use[MAXA], phi[MAXA], cnt[MAXA];\nvector<int> divisors[MAXA];\nll bin[MAXN], res;\n\nll inv(ll a, ll p){\n if(a == 1) return 1;\n return (p - p / a) * inv(p % a, p) % p;\n}\n\nvoid read(){\n scanf(\"%d%d%d\", &N, &K, &Q);\n for(int i = 0; i < N + Q; i++){\n scanf(\"%d\", &A[i]);\n use[A[i]] = 1;\n }\n}\n\nvoid init(){\n iota(phi, phi + MAXA, 0);\n for(int i = 1; i < MAXA; i++){\n for(int j = i; j < MAXA; j += i){\n if(i != j) phi[j] -= phi[i];\n if(use[j]) divisors[j].push_back(i);\n }\n }\n bin[K - 1] = 1;\n for(int i = K; i < MAXN; i++){\n bin[i] = bin[i - 1] * i % MOD * inv(i - K + 1, MOD) % MOD;\n }\n}\n\nint main(){\n read();\n init();\n for(int i = 0; i < N + Q; i++){\n for(int d : divisors[A[i]]){\n res = (res + bin[cnt[d]] * phi[d]) % MOD;\n cnt[d] += 1;\n }\n if(i >= N){\n printf(\"%dn\", res);\n }\n }\n}645G - Armistice Area ApportionmentIdea: yummyThanks to jqdai0815 and Petr for sharing a solution with me that is much more intuitive than the one I originally had in mind! It works as follows:First, let’s try to solve the smaller case where we only have two points. Let be the line passing through xi and xj. We want to compute the difference of relative to P and Q. Define P’ as the reflection of P over . By the triangle inequality, we have |PX - QX| = |P’X - QX| ≤ P’Q. Equality can be achieved when X, P’ and Q are collinear—that is, when X is the intersection of and line P’Q. (If and P’Q are parallel, we can imagine that they intersect at infinity.) Therefore, the difference of a line relative to P and Q is the distance from P’ to Q.We can also think about P’ in a different way. Let Ci be the circle with center xi that pases through P. Then P’ is the second intersection of the two circles Ci and Cj. Thus our problem of finding a line with minimum difference becomes equivalent to finding the intersection among {Ci} that lies closest to Q. This last part we can do with a binary search.Consider the problem of checking if two circles Ci and Cj intersect at a point within a distance r of Q. In other words, we wish to check if they intersect inside a circle S of radius r centered at Q. Let Ai and Aj be the arcs of S contained by Ci and Cj, respectively. Observe that Ci and Cj intersect inside the circle if and only if the two arcs overlap, but do not contain each other. Thus we can verify this condition for all pairs of points with a radial sweep line along the circle. Due to the binary search and the sorting necessary for the sweep line, this solution runs in , where P is the precision required.One might also wonder if precision will be an issue with all the calculations that we’re doing. It turns out that it won’t be, since our binary search will always stabilize the problem and get us very close to the answer. Here’s my original solution using a projective transformation:We begin by binary searching on the the minimum possible difference. Thus we wish to solve the decision problem \"Can a difference of k be achieved?\" Consider the hyperbola |PX - QX| = k. Note that our answer is affirmative if and only if a pair of outposts defines a line that does not intersect the hyperbola.Our next step is a reduction to an equivalent decision problem on a circle through a projective transformation. We express this transformation as the composition of two simpler operations. The first is an affine map that takes the hyperbola |PX - QX| = k to the unit hyperbola. The second maps homogenous coordinates (x, y, z) to (z, y, x). Under the latter, the unit hyperbola x2 - y2 = z2 goes to the unit circle x2 + y2 = z2.Because projective transformations preserve collinearity, a line intersecting the hyperbola is equivalent to a line intersecting the circle. Thus we want to know if any pair of the outposts' images defines a line that does not intersect the circle. We now map the image of each outpost to the minor arc on the unit circle defined by its tangents. (We disregard any points lying inside the circle.) Observe that our condition is equivalent to the existence of two intersecting arcs, neither of which contains the other. Verifying that two such arcs exist can be done with a priority queue and a radial sweep line in .The total complexity of our solution is therefore , where P is the precision that we need. It turns out that the implementation of this algorithm is actually pretty neat: Code#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\n\ntypedef long double ld;\n\nconst ld EPS = 1e-12;\nconst ld PI = acos(-1);\nconst int MAXN = 100005;\nint N;\nld A, X[MAXN], Y[MAXN];\n\nbool check(ld m){\n ld u = m / 2;\n ld v = sqrt(A * A - u * u);\n vector<pair<ld,ld>> ev;\n for(int i = 0; i < N; i++){\n ld x = 1, y = Y[i] / v, alpha;\n if(X[i] != 0){\n x *= u / X[i], y *= u / X[i];\n ld r = sqrt(x * x + y * y);\n if(r < 1) continue;\n alpha = acos(1 / r);\n } else {\n alpha = PI / 2;\n }\n ld base = atan2(y, x) - alpha;\n if(base < 0) base += 2 * PI;\n ev.push_back({base, base + 2 * alpha});\n }\n priority_queue<ld, vector<ld>, greater<ld>> pq;\n sort(ev.begin(), ev.end());\n for(int i = 0; i < 2; i++){\n for(int j = 0; j < ev.size(); j++){\n while(pq.size() && pq.top() < ev[j].first) pq.pop();\n if(pq.size() && pq.top() < ev[j].second) return 1;\n pq.push(ev[j].second);\n ev[j].first += 2 * PI;\n ev[j].second += 2 * PI;\n }\n }\n return 0;\n}\n\nint main(){\n ios::sync_with_stdio(0);\n cin >> N >> A;\n for(int i = 0; i < N; i++){\n cin >> X[i] >> Y[i];\n }\n ld lo = 0, hi = 2 * A;\n while(hi - lo > EPS){\n ld mid = (lo + hi) / 2;\n (check(mid) ? hi : lo) = mid;\n }\n cout << fixed << setprecision(10);\n cout << (lo + hi) / 2 << 'n';\n}",

          "content": "Hey Codeforces!The Elimination Round of the CROC 2016 Championship will take place on Friday, March 18 at 16:35 UTC. After our last round, Yang Liu (desert97), Michael Kural (pi37) and I realized that we haven't had enough, so we joined forces with Kevin Sun (ksun48) and Daniel Chiu (waterfalls) to prepare another problem set for you guys. Our contest will be for combined divisions and consist of seven problems. And although only those who pass the Qualification Round can participate officially, the round will be open to and rated for all Codeforces users. As always, we'll be taking the tractor to Bovinia for some farmland algorithmic adventures with Farmer John, Bessie and her best friend Elsie!Before we begin, we'd like to thank GlebsHP for doing a wonderful job as contest coordinator—we'd be hopeless without you. We would also like to thank MikeMirzayanov and the Codeforces staff for creating the awesome Codeforces and Polygon platforms. And finally, we're immensely grateful to abacadaea for providing one of the problem ideas and to winger and AlexFetisov for test solving our round.Formally, there will be two rounds on the same problem set (both rated): CROC 2016 — Elimination Round: for registered Championship participants who have passed the Qualification, CROC 2016 — Elimination Round (Rated Unofficial Edition): for all others. To take part in the official round you have to be registered for the Championship and solve at least one problem in Qualification round. Both the elimination round and its unofficial edition will be rated. The only difference is that the top 50 participants in the official round will be invited to join the Finals in Moscow. Finalists will be responsible for organizing their trip (tickets, hotel, visas and so on). Each participant may claim reimbursement for transportation expenses not exceeding ~135 USD. Invitations should be accepted no later than March 25.We hope you enjoy our problems and our cow-flavored text even more than you did last time! Good luck!UPD1: System testing is delayed because we are investigating some technical issues.UPD2: The editorial has been posted here. Thanks for participating!UPD3: Since last ~15 minutes judging system was incorrectly configured for F in the contest \"CROC 2016 — Elimination Round\" (it is interesting story how it happened), you may appeal your rating change if it affected you much. If you have submitted a solution for F in last 15 minutes and you have strong arguments why incorrect verdict (WA/RE on the test 1) significantly affected your place, please write MikeMirzayanov to make your participation unrated. Sorry about the issue. You can do it before March, 19, 23:59 (UTC).UPD4: I'd like to congratulate the winners of each round, as well as the top 50 in the Elimination Round for progressing to the CROC 2016 Championship Finals!

          "content": "645A - Amity AssessmentIdea: yummyOne solution is to just brute force and use DFS to try all the possibilities. Alternatively, note that two puzzles can be changed to each other if and only if the A, B, and C have the same orientation—clockwise or counterclockwise—in the puzzle. A third option, since the number of possibilities is so small, is to simply classify all of the 4! = 24 configurations by hand. Code#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\n\nstring b, b1, b2, e, e1, e2;\n\nint main(){\n cin >> b1 >> b2 >> e1 >> e2;\n swap(b2[0], b2[1]);\n swap(e2[0], e2[1]);\n b = b1 + b2;\n e = e1 + e2;\n b.erase(b.find('X'), 1);\n e.erase(e.find('X'), 1);\n if((b + b).find(e) != string::npos){\n\tcout << \"YESn\";\n } else {\n\tcout << \"NOn\";\n }\n}\n645B - Mischievous Mess MakersIdea: ksun48Loosely speaking, we’re trying to reverse the array as much as possible.Intuitively, the optimal solution seems to be to switch the first and last cow, then the second and second-to-last cow, and so on for k minutes, unless the sequence is reversed already, in which case we are done. But how can we show that these moves give the optimal messiness?It is clear when 2·k ≥ n - 1 that we can reverse the array with this method.However, when 2·k < n - 1, there are going to be cows that we must not have not moved a single time. Since in each move we swap at most 2 cows, there must be at least n - 2·k cows that we have not touched, with pi = i. Two untouched cows i and j must have pi < pj, so there must be at least pairs of cows which are ordered correctly.In fact, if we follow the above process, we get that pi = (n + 1) - i for the first k and last k cows, while pi = i for the middle n - 2·k cows. From this we can see that the both i < j and pi < pj happen only when i and j are in the middle n - 2·k cows. Therefore we know our algorithm is optimal.An O(k) solution, therefore, is to count how many incorrectly ordered pairs (i, j) are created at each step and add them up. When we swap cow i and (n + 1) - i in step i, this creates 1 + 2·(n - 2i) more pairs. So the answer will be .We can reduce this to O(1) by using our earlier observation, that every pair except those pairs are unordered, which gives total pairs (i, j). Note that this does always not fit in a 32-bit integer. Code#include<bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\ntypedef long long LL;\n\nint main(){\n\tLL n, k;\n\tcin >> n >> k;\n\tLL c = max(n-2*k,0LL);\n\tLL a = n*(n-1)/2-c*(c-1)/2;\n\tcout << a << endl;\n}645C - Enduring ExodusIdea: GlebsHPFirst, observe that the k + 1 rooms that Farmer John books should be consecutive empty rooms. Thus we can loop over all such sets of rooms with a sliding window in linear time. To check the next set of rooms, we simply advance each endpoint of our interval to the next empty room. Every time we do this, we need to compute the optimal placement of Farmer John’s room. We can maintain the position of his room with two pointers—as we slide our window of rooms to the right, the optimal position of Farmer John’s room should always move to the right or remain the same. This solution runs in O(n). Alternatively, we can use binary search or an STL set to find the best placement for Farmer John’s room as we iterate over the intervals of rooms. The complexity of these approaches is . Code#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint N, K, res = 1e9;\nstring S;\n\nint next(int i){ // finds the next empty room\n do {\n i += 1;\n } while(i < N && S[i] == '1');\n return i;\n}\n\nint main(){\n cin >> N >> K >> S;\n int l = next(-1), m = l, r = l;\n for(int i = 0; i < K; i++){ // sets up the sliding window\n r = next(r);\n }\n while(r < N){\n while(max(m - l, r - m) > max(next(m) - l, r - next(m))){\n m = next(m);\n }\n res = min(res, max(m - l, r - m));\n l = next(l);\n r = next(r);\n }\n cout << res << 'n';\n}645D - Robot Rapping Results ReportIdea: abacadaeaThe robots will become fully sorted if and only if there exists a path with n vertices in the directed graph defined by the match results. Because it is guaranteed that the results are not contradictory, this graph must be directed and acyclic—a DAG. Thus we can compute the longest path in this DAG via dynamic programming or a toposort.We now have two cases. First, if the longest path contains n vertices, then it must uniquely define the ordering of the robots. This means the answer is the time at which the last edge was added to this path. Otherwise, if the longest path has fewer than n vertices, then multiple orderings satisfy the results and you should print  - 1. Note that this algorithm runs in O(n + m).Another solution to this problem binary searches on the answer. For some k, consider only those edges that were added before time k. We can determine if the robots could be totally ordered at time k by running a toposort and checking if the longest path covers all n vertices. This might be more intuitive for some, but has a complexity of . Code#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\n\nconst int MAXN = 1000005;\nint N, M, dp[MAXN], res[MAXN];\nvector<pair<int,int>> adj[MAXN];\n\nint check(int v){\n if(dp[v]) return dp[v];\n dp[v] = 1;\n for(auto p : adj[v]){\n int n = p.first;\n if(check(n) + 1 > dp[v]){\n dp[v] = dp[n] + 1;\n res[v] = max(res[n], p.second);\n }\n }\n return dp[v];\n}\n\nint main(){\n scanf(\"%d%d\", &N, &M);\n for(int i = 0; i < M; i++){\n int a, b;\n scanf(\"%d%d\", &a, &b);\n a -= 1, b -= 1;\n adj[a].push_back({b, i + 1});\n }\n for(int i = 0; i < N; i++){\n if(check(i) == N){\n printf(\"%dn\", res[i]);\n return 0;\n }\n }\n printf(\"-1n\");\n}645E - Intellectual InquiryIdea: yummyFor simplicity, let’s represent the letters by 1, 2, ..., k instead of actual characters. Let a[i] denote the number of distinct subsequences of the string that end in the letter i. Appending the letter j to a string only changes the value of a[j]. Note that the new a[j] becomes —we can have the single letter j, or append j to any of our old subsequences.The key observation is that no matter what character j we choose to append, a[j] will always end up the same. This suggests a greedy algorithm—always appending the character j with the smallest a[j]. But how do we know which a[j] is minimal while maintaining their values modulo 109 + 7?The final observation is that if the last occurrence of j is after the last occurrence of j' in our string, then a[j] > a[j']. This is true because appending j to the string makes a[j] larger than all other a[i]. So instead of choosing the minimum a[i], we can always choose the letter that appeared least recently. Since the sequence of letters we append becomes periodic, our solution runs in . Of course, we can also find the least recently used letter with less efficient approaches, obtaining solutions with complexity O((L + n)k). Code#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\n\ntypedef long long ll;\n\nconst ll MOD = 1000000007;\nconst int MAXK = 26;\nint N, K, last[MAXK], ord[MAXK];\nll dp[MAXK], sum;\nstring S;\n\nbool comp(int a, int b){\n return last[a] < last[b];\n}\n\nvoid append(int c){\n sum = (sum - dp[c] + MOD) % MOD;\n dp[c] = (dp[c] + sum + 1) % MOD;\n sum = (sum + dp[c]) % MOD;\n}\n\nint main(){\n cin >> N >> K >> S;\n fill(last, last + K, -1);\n for(int i = 0; i < S.size(); i++){\n int c = S[i] - 'a';\n last[c] = i;\n append(c);\n }\n iota(ord, ord + K, 0);\n sort(ord, ord + K, comp);\n for(int i = 0; i < N; i++){\n int c = ord[i % K];\n append(c);\n }\n cout << (sum + 1) % MOD << 'n';\n}645F - Cowslip CollectionsIdea: desert97After each query, the problem is essentially asking us to compute the sum of for each choice of k flowers. One quickly notes that it is too slow to loop over all choices of k flowers, as there could be up to choices of k species.So how can we compute a sum over terms? Well, we will definitely need to use the properties of the gcd function. If we figure out for each integer a ≤ 106 how many times occurs in the sum (let this be g(a)), then our answer will be equal to overall all a.It seems that if d(a) is the number of multiples of a in our sequence, then there are k-tuples which have gcd a. Yet there is something wrong with this reasoning: some of those k-tuples can have gcd 2a, or 3a, or any multiple of a. In fact, , the number of gcds which are a multiple of a. We will try to write as a sum of these . We’ll take an example, when a ranges from 1 to 4. The sum we wish to compute is g(1) + 2g(2) + 3g(3) + 4g(4) which can be written as (g(1) + g(2) + g(3) + g(4)) + (g(2) + g(4)) + 2(g(3)) + 2(g(4)), or In general, we want to find coefficients pi such that we can write as . Equating coefficients of g(a) on both sides, we get that . (The mathematically versed reader will note that pi = φ(i), Euler's totient function, but this is not necessary to solve the problem.)We can thus precalculate all pi in using a recursive formula: . We can also precalculate for each l ≤ 200000, so in order to output after each query we should keep track of the values of the function d(i), the number of multiples of i. When receiving ci flowers, we only need to update d for the divisors of ci and add . If we precompute the list of divisors of every integer using a sieve or sqrt checking, each update requires O(divisors).Thus the complexity of this algorithm is or preprocessing, and O((n + q)·max(divisors)). Code#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\n\ntypedef long long ll;\n\nconst ll MOD = 1000000007;\nconst int MAXN = 200005;\nconst int MAXA = 1000005;\nint N, K, Q, A[MAXN];\nint use[MAXA], phi[MAXA], cnt[MAXA];\nvector<int> divisors[MAXA];\nll bin[MAXN], res;\n\nll inv(ll a, ll p){\n if(a == 1) return 1;\n return (p - p / a) * inv(p % a, p) % p;\n}\n\nvoid read(){\n scanf(\"%d%d%d\", &N, &K, &Q);\n for(int i = 0; i < N + Q; i++){\n scanf(\"%d\", &A[i]);\n use[A[i]] = 1;\n }\n}\n\nvoid init(){\n iota(phi, phi + MAXA, 0);\n for(int i = 1; i < MAXA; i++){\n for(int j = i; j < MAXA; j += i){\n if(i != j) phi[j] -= phi[i];\n if(use[j]) divisors[j].push_back(i);\n }\n }\n bin[K - 1] = 1;\n for(int i = K; i < MAXN; i++){\n bin[i] = bin[i - 1] * i % MOD * inv(i - K + 1, MOD) % MOD;\n }\n}\n\nint main(){\n read();\n init();\n for(int i = 0; i < N + Q; i++){\n for(int d : divisors[A[i]]){\n res = (res + bin[cnt[d]] * phi[d]) % MOD;\n cnt[d] += 1;\n }\n if(i >= N){\n printf(\"%dn\", res);\n }\n }\n}645G - Armistice Area ApportionmentIdea: yummyThanks to jqdai0815 and Petr for sharing a solution with me that is much more intuitive than the one I originally had in mind! It works as follows:First, let’s try to solve the smaller case where we only have two points. Let be the line passing through xi and xj. We want to compute the difference of relative to P and Q. Define P’ as the reflection of P over . By the triangle inequality, we have |PX - QX| = |P’X - QX| ≤ P’Q. Equality can be achieved when X, P’ and Q are collinear—that is, when X is the intersection of and line P’Q. (If and P’Q are parallel, we can imagine that they intersect at infinity.) Therefore, the difference of a line relative to P and Q is the distance from P’ to Q.We can also think about P’ in a different way. Let Ci be the circle with center xi that pases through P. Then P’ is the second intersection of the two circles Ci and Cj. Thus our problem of finding a line with minimum difference becomes equivalent to finding the intersection among {Ci} that lies closest to Q. This last part we can do with a binary search.Consider the problem of checking if two circles Ci and Cj intersect at a point within a distance r of Q. In other words, we wish to check if they intersect inside a circle S of radius r centered at Q. Let Ai and Aj be the arcs of S contained by Ci and Cj, respectively. Observe that Ci and Cj intersect inside the circle if and only if the two arcs overlap, but do not contain each other. Thus we can verify this condition for all pairs of points with a radial sweep line along the circle. Due to the binary search and the sorting necessary for the sweep line, this solution runs in , where P is the precision required.One might also wonder if precision will be an issue with all the calculations that we’re doing. It turns out that it won’t be, since our binary search will always stabilize the problem and get us very close to the answer. Here’s my original solution using a projective transformation:We begin by binary searching on the the minimum possible difference. Thus we wish to solve the decision problem \"Can a difference of k be achieved?\" Consider the hyperbola |PX - QX| = k. Note that our answer is affirmative if and only if a pair of outposts defines a line that does not intersect the hyperbola.Our next step is a reduction to an equivalent decision problem on a circle through a projective transformation. We express this transformation as the composition of two simpler operations. The first is an affine map that takes the hyperbola |PX - QX| = k to the unit hyperbola. The second maps homogenous coordinates (x, y, z) to (z, y, x). Under the latter, the unit hyperbola x2 - y2 = z2 goes to the unit circle x2 + y2 = z2.Because projective transformations preserve collinearity, a line intersecting the hyperbola is equivalent to a line intersecting the circle. Thus we want to know if any pair of the outposts' images defines a line that does not intersect the circle. We now map the image of each outpost to the minor arc on the unit circle defined by its tangents. (We disregard any points lying inside the circle.) Observe that our condition is equivalent to the existence of two intersecting arcs, neither of which contains the other. Verifying that two such arcs exist can be done with a priority queue and a radial sweep line in .The total complexity of our solution is therefore , where P is the precision that we need. It turns out that the implementation of this algorithm is actually pretty neat: Code#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\n\ntypedef long double ld;\n\nconst ld EPS = 1e-12;\nconst ld PI = acos(-1);\nconst int MAXN = 100005;\nint N;\nld A, X[MAXN], Y[MAXN];\n\nbool check(ld m){\n ld u = m / 2;\n ld v = sqrt(A * A - u * u);\n vector<pair<ld,ld>> ev;\n for(int i = 0; i < N; i++){\n ld x = 1, y = Y[i] / v, alpha;\n if(X[i] != 0){\n x *= u / X[i], y *= u / X[i];\n ld r = sqrt(x * x + y * y);\n if(r < 1) continue;\n alpha = acos(1 / r);\n } else {\n alpha = PI / 2;\n }\n ld base = atan2(y, x) - alpha;\n if(base < 0) base += 2 * PI;\n ev.push_back({base, base + 2 * alpha});\n }\n priority_queue<ld, vector<ld>, greater<ld>> pq;\n sort(ev.begin(), ev.end());\n for(int i = 0; i < 2; i++){\n for(int j = 0; j < ev.size(); j++){\n while(pq.size() && pq.top() < ev[j].first) pq.pop();\n if(pq.size() && pq.top() < ev[j].second) return 1;\n pq.push(ev[j].second);\n ev[j].first += 2 * PI;\n ev[j].second += 2 * PI;\n }\n }\n return 0;\n}\n\nint main(){\n ios::sync_with_stdio(0);\n cin >> N >> A;\n for(int i = 0; i < N; i++){\n cin >> X[i] >> Y[i];\n }\n ld lo = 0, hi = 2 * A;\n while(hi - lo > EPS){\n ld mid = (lo + hi) / 2;\n (check(mid) ? hi : lo) = mid;\n }\n cout << fixed << setprecision(10);\n cout << (lo + hi) / 2 << 'n';\n}",

Let's start with the 500 grams of sand. Apply the first spell 5 times and turn the sand into 1000 grams of lead. Then apply the second spell 4 times to get 600 grams of gold. Let’s take 400 grams from the resulting amount of gold turn them back into sand. We get 500 grams of sand and 200 grams of gold. If we apply the same operations to 500 grams of sand again, we can get extra 200 grams of gold every time. Thus, you can get 200, 400, 600 etc. grams of gold, i.e., starting with a finite amount of sand (500 grams), you can get the amount of gold which is greater than any preassigned number.In the forth sample it is impossible to get sand, or lead, or gold, applying the spells.In the fifth sample an infinitely large amount of gold can be obtained by using only the second spell, which allows you to receive 1 gram of gold out of nothing. Note that if such a second spell is available, then the first and the third one do not affect the answer at all.The seventh sample is more interesting. We can also start with a zero amount of sand there. With the aid of the third spell you can get sand out of nothing. We get 10000 grams of sand in this manner. Let's get 100 grams of lead using the first spell 100 times. Then make 1 gram of gold from them. We managed to receive 1 gram of gold, starting with a zero amount of sand! Clearly, in this manner you can get an infinitely large amount of gold.",

          "content": "Problem AFist, consider the case when all the numbers are non-zero. You can take a*c*e grams of sand, turn them into b*c*e grams of lead, and them turn into b*d*e grams of gold, and them turn into b*d*f grams of sand. If b*d*f > a*c*e, you can infinitely increase the amount of sand and consequently the amount of gold. Otherwise, if b*d*f <= a*c*e, it is impossible to get infinitely large amount of gold. The same is true when the fraction  (a*c*e)/(b*d*f) has zero numerator only or zero denuminator only. Otherwise there is 0/0, and  you have to check cases specially.I explain, why I make this problem to be problem A.1. Solution of the problem requires very little knowledge of programming (only \"if\"), so it was feasible for all participants.2. Tricky cases really exist, but I hoped that \"stronger competitors will ... help newcomers to catch all bugs by their hacks\". And so it happened.Maybe I was wrong: this problem is too complex for A.A large number of hacks for this problem is a quite foreseen circumstance. I haven't include the special class of tests into the pretests intendently, to make hacking more interesting. In fairness I should note that Artem Rakhov was against this idea. Beause of this task the problem surfaced that Gassa writes about here in Russian: pretests cover some incomplete set of cases and it is not clear in advance what the event \"solution passed pretests\" means. I think it should be discussed, and strong principles of pretests development should be stated.Problem B The problem has greedy solution. Change a digit in the first date to make it as small as possible. At each of the next steps try all one-digit exchanges in the current date and choose one that makes the date not less than the previous one and as small as possible at the same time. If the last year won't exceed 2011 - the answer is found. Otherwise there is no solution.How to prove that? Consider any correct answer. Clearly, if the first date in it is different from the smallest possible number that can be obtained from the first of given years, your can put the smallest number instead of it. The second date can be exchanged by the smallest possible number not exceeding the first number, etc.Ar a result you obtain a greedy solution that is built by the algorithm described above. If the greedy solution doesn't exist, solution doesn't esist too.The problem also has a dynamic solution.Problem CCheck for each segment in the polyline if Harry can catch the snitch in it. Note that since vp ≥ vs, if Harry can catch the snitch at some moment of time, he can catch it at any later moment. He can just follow snitch along its trajectory. So use binary search in each segment.About problems with EPS that participants got. The problems may be caused by1) some EPS in the condition: while (leftTime + EPS < rightTime) <do binary search>. The task was to output with a fixed accurancy not only the time, but also the point coordinates. If the difference between the time and the right one is less than EPS, the difference between coordinates may be significantly larger. In such cases you should compare not arguments of a function, but values of the function with EPS. Or the way that I usually follow and that once was not liked by the teacher of numerical methods - to implement some fixed number of iterations of the binary search (say, 60).  2) EPS in comparison of time moments inside the binary search like this:if (currentTime + addTime > distance / potterSpeed - EPS)                                                rightTime = currentTime;                                        else                                                leftTime = currentTime;Here it is better to remove EPS at all. Or to put EPS significantly smaller than the required accurancy for printing the point.(Code fragments are from Egor's solution.)Thus, there was no crime with severe limitations. Probably for such problems extreme accurancy tests should be in pretests? It is about principles of pretests making again. UPD. The problem has an analytical solution too. Consider the i-th segment. Let (xi, yi, zi) and (xi + 1, yi + 1, zi + 1) be its ends, and let ti be the time required for the snitch to reach the beginning of the segment. Then at the moment t the snitch will be at the point (x, y, z), x = xi + (xi + 1 - xi)(t - ti) / Ti, y = yi + (yi + 1 - yi)(t - ti) / Ti, z = zi + (zi + 1 - zi)(t - ti) / Ti, Ti is a time necessary for snitch to overcome the segment. To catch the snitch at the point (x, y, z), Harry have to overcome the distance that squared is equal to (x - Px)2 + (y - Py)2 + (z - Pz)2 for the time t. It is possible if (x - Px)2 + (y - Py)2 + (z - Pz)2 ≤ (tvp)2. To find the minimal proper moment t, solve the corresponding quadratic equation.Problem DLet Si be a set of all possible assignments of the first i students to the houses, that is a set of tuples (a1, a2, a3, a4), where a1 is a number of students sent to Gryffindor, a2 - to Ravenclaw, etc. It's intuitively clear that these sets will not be large. So you can get Si - 1 from Si in a trivial way, and get finally Sn, and determine the answer from it. What is a rigorous proof of the algorithm? Let us have a set S = {(ai1, ai2, ai3, ai4)}i = 1, 2, ..., k. Represent its elements as aij = bj + xij, xij ≥ 0, where bj are maximal possible, i.e. there is i for each j such that xij = 0. Let the tuple (b1, b2, b3, b4) be called the base part of S, and the set {(xi1, xi2, xi3, xi4)}i = 1, 2, ..., k be called the variant part of S. Initially for S0 both base and variant parts are zeroes. Let us see how base and variant parts change when a current student is added. If a house is fixed for the student, only the base part changes. It increases by 1 at the position corresponding to the house. In particular, it follows that a set with every base part can be obtained (since the string given in the input can contain every combination of symbols G, H, R, S). If the current symbol in the string is '?', it can influence both base and variant parts.For example, for the string '????' we have:S0 = {(0 + 0, 0 + 0, 0 + 0, 0 + 0)},S1 = {(0 + 1, 0 + 0, 0 + 0, 0 + 0), (0 + 0, 0 + 1, 0 + 0, 0 + 0), (0 + 0, 0 + 0, 0 + 1, 0 + 0), (0 + 0, 0 + 0, 0 + 0, 0 + 1)},S2 = {(0 + 1, 0 + 1, 0 + 0, 0 + 0), (0 + 1, 0 + 0, 0 + 1, 0 + 0), (0 + 1, 0 + 0, 0 + 0, 0 + 1), (0 + 0, 0 + 1, 0 + 1, 0 + 0), (0 + 0, 0 + 1, 0 + 0, 0 + 1), (0 + 0, 0 + 0, 0 + 1, 0 + 1)},S3 = {(0 + 1, 0 + 1, 0 + 1, 0 + 0), (0 + 1, 0 + 1, 0 + 0, 0 + 1), (0 + 1, 0 + 0, 0 + 1, 0 + 1), (0 + 0, 0 + 1, 0 + 1, 0 + 1)},S4 = {(1 + 0, 1 + 0, 1 + 0, 1 + 0)}.Let us investigate the question of what species a variant part may have. It can be analyzed independently from a base one, taking into account that a base part can be any. Consider a directed graph with vertices corresponding to variant parts and with edges determined by the existence of at least one base part that let go from one variant part to another. We are interested only in vertices reachable from {(0, 0, 0, 0)}.Proposition. For all the vertices reachable from zero the following properties hold(1) xij ≤ 2,(2) k ≤ 13.Let us prove that all the vertices not having the properties (1) and (2) are unreachable from zero. Consider a variant part with the property (1). To get all edges going from it you have to try all possible base parts. Note that base parts, that consist of the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3 and contain at lest one 0, are enough. Indeed, base part influence which elements are minimal, and 1 will be added to them. A base part can be always normed to contain at least one 0. If a base part contains numbers greater than 3, then the corresponding positions will never be minimal (since 4+0 > 0+2) and they can be changed equivalently by 3 (3+0 > 0+2).Unfortunately, my attempts to deal with cases by hand were unsuccessful, so I wrote the program that traverse the described graph. Starting from 0, it builds edges trying only \"small\" base parts described in the previous paragraph. As a result, the program obtains all the reachable variant parts (there is a little more than 1000 of them) and check (1) and (2) for them. In addition, the program helps to construct a test with k = 13.The problem was supposed to be a problem on intuition. Participants have another solution passed. Their solution generate all permutations and distribute students greedily with respect to each permutation.This solution was a complete surprise for me. Unfortunately, it is wrong. Test 66 against it was added. Of course, submissions accepted during the round won't be rejudged. If such a solution be expected, most likely I wouldn't give such a task. In terms of intuition this solution is not better and not worse than mine. I hope you will not judge me strictly: it is a beautiful problem, and it was interesting to see how it would be solved. Problem EConsider a graph with floors as vertices and staircases as edges. It is clear that Harry can visit the whole connected component in which he is currently located.Every edge can be used to reach a new vertex for not more than two times. If a connected component contains n vertices and m edges, only n - 1 edges are used to reach a new vertex during its traversal. The remaining m - n + 1 edges are not used to reach a new vertex in their initial placement. So they will be used to reach a new vertex not more than once.So using edges of only one connected component you can reach no more than n - m + 1 new vertices. Totally there are not more than   reachable vertices. If m < k - 1, it is impossible to visit all the vertices.  We show that otherwise (m >= k - 1), if the degree of the vertex 0 is different from zero, it is possible to visit all the vertices. In other words, there is such a traversal that every edge can be moved.  Use depth-first search for the current component. If a current edge goes to an already visited vertex, move it to a new component and traverse it recursively. If a current edge goes to a new vertex, after you visit this vertex and go back, you also can move this edge to a new component. As a result each edge can be moved and used again, if you reach all the components. If a component contains at least one edge, you can go from it to the next one. First visit components with edges, and you will visit them all and by the inequality (m >= k - 1) there are enough edges to visit all the isolated vertices.  If the degree of the vertex 1 is zero, you can not start a traversal before you move some edge to it. After that you can go by this edge and remove it with the vertex 1 from the graph, becase you can not use this edge once more. If the chose edge is a bridge, you get k connected components and m - 1 egdes. If it is not a bridge, you get k - 1 components and m - 1 edges. In the first case the inequality m >= k - 1 turns m >= k. In the second case -  m >= k - 1. So if not all the edges are bridges, you should not take a bridge. If they all are bridges, you should disconnect an edge from a vertex of degree >= 2 not to came back to the initial situation with the zero degree of the first vertex. If there is no such vertex, it is easy to check that there is no solution.",

          "content": "Problem AFist, consider the case when all the numbers are non-zero. You can take a*c*e grams of sand, turn them into b*c*e grams of lead, and them turn into b*d*e grams of gold, and them turn into b*d*f grams of sand. If b*d*f > a*c*e, you can infinitely increase the amount of sand and consequently the amount of gold. Otherwise, if b*d*f <= a*c*e, it is impossible to get infinitely large amount of gold. The same is true when the fraction  (a*c*e)/(b*d*f) has zero numerator only or zero denuminator only. Otherwise there is 0/0, and  you have to check cases specially.I explain, why I make this problem to be problem A.1. Solution of the problem requires very little knowledge of programming (only \"if\"), so it was feasible for all participants.2. Tricky cases really exist, but I hoped that \"stronger competitors will ... help newcomers to catch all bugs by their hacks\". And so it happened.Maybe I was wrong: this problem is too complex for A.A large number of hacks for this problem is a quite foreseen circumstance. I haven't include the special class of tests into the pretests intendently, to make hacking more interesting. In fairness I should note that Artem Rakhov was against this idea. Beause of this task the problem surfaced that Gassa writes about here in Russian: pretests cover some incomplete set of cases and it is not clear in advance what the event \"solution passed pretests\" means. I think it should be discussed, and strong principles of pretests development should be stated.Problem B The problem has greedy solution. Change a digit in the first date to make it as small as possible. At each of the next steps try all one-digit exchanges in the current date and choose one that makes the date not less than the previous one and as small as possible at the same time. If the last year won't exceed 2011 - the answer is found. Otherwise there is no solution.How to prove that? Consider any correct answer. Clearly, if the first date in it is different from the smallest possible number that can be obtained from the first of given years, your can put the smallest number instead of it. The second date can be exchanged by the smallest possible number not exceeding the first number, etc.Ar a result you obtain a greedy solution that is built by the algorithm described above. If the greedy solution doesn't exist, solution doesn't esist too.The problem also has a dynamic solution.Problem CCheck for each segment in the polyline if Harry can catch the snitch in it. Note that since vp ≥ vs, if Harry can catch the snitch at some moment of time, he can catch it at any later moment. He can just follow snitch along its trajectory. So use binary search in each segment.About problems with EPS that participants got. The problems may be caused by1) some EPS in the condition: while (leftTime + EPS < rightTime) <do binary search>. The task was to output with a fixed accurancy not only the time, but also the point coordinates. If the difference between the time and the right one is less than EPS, the difference between coordinates may be significantly larger. In such cases you should compare not arguments of a function, but values of the function with EPS. Or the way that I usually follow and that once was not liked by the teacher of numerical methods - to implement some fixed number of iterations of the binary search (say, 60).  2) EPS in comparison of time moments inside the binary search like this:if (currentTime + addTime > distance / potterSpeed - EPS)                                                rightTime = currentTime;                                        else                                                leftTime = currentTime;Here it is better to remove EPS at all. Or to put EPS significantly smaller than the required accurancy for printing the point.(Code fragments are from Egor's solution.)Thus, there was no crime with severe limitations. Probably for such problems extreme accurancy tests should be in pretests? It is about principles of pretests making again. UPD. The problem has an analytical solution too. Consider the i-th segment. Let (xi, yi, zi) and (xi + 1, yi + 1, zi + 1) be its ends, and let ti be the time required for the snitch to reach the beginning of the segment. Then at the moment t the snitch will be at the point (x, y, z), x = xi + (xi + 1 - xi)(t - ti) / Ti, y = yi + (yi + 1 - yi)(t - ti) / Ti, z = zi + (zi + 1 - zi)(t - ti) / Ti, Ti is a time necessary for snitch to overcome the segment. To catch the snitch at the point (x, y, z), Harry have to overcome the distance that squared is equal to (x - Px)2 + (y - Py)2 + (z - Pz)2 for the time t. It is possible if (x - Px)2 + (y - Py)2 + (z - Pz)2 ≤ (tvp)2. To find the minimal proper moment t, solve the corresponding quadratic equation.Problem DLet Si be a set of all possible assignments of the first i students to the houses, that is a set of tuples (a1, a2, a3, a4), where a1 is a number of students sent to Gryffindor, a2 - to Ravenclaw, etc. It's intuitively clear that these sets will not be large. So you can get Si - 1 from Si in a trivial way, and get finally Sn, and determine the answer from it. What is a rigorous proof of the algorithm? Let us have a set S = {(ai1, ai2, ai3, ai4)}i = 1, 2, ..., k. Represent its elements as aij = bj + xij, xij ≥ 0, where bj are maximal possible, i.e. there is i for each j such that xij = 0. Let the tuple (b1, b2, b3, b4) be called the base part of S, and the set {(xi1, xi2, xi3, xi4)}i = 1, 2, ..., k be called the variant part of S. Initially for S0 both base and variant parts are zeroes. Let us see how base and variant parts change when a current student is added. If a house is fixed for the student, only the base part changes. It increases by 1 at the position corresponding to the house. In particular, it follows that a set with every base part can be obtained (since the string given in the input can contain every combination of symbols G, H, R, S). If the current symbol in the string is '?', it can influence both base and variant parts.For example, for the string '????' we have:S0 = {(0 + 0, 0 + 0, 0 + 0, 0 + 0)},S1 = {(0 + 1, 0 + 0, 0 + 0, 0 + 0), (0 + 0, 0 + 1, 0 + 0, 0 + 0), (0 + 0, 0 + 0, 0 + 1, 0 + 0), (0 + 0, 0 + 0, 0 + 0, 0 + 1)},S2 = {(0 + 1, 0 + 1, 0 + 0, 0 + 0), (0 + 1, 0 + 0, 0 + 1, 0 + 0), (0 + 1, 0 + 0, 0 + 0, 0 + 1), (0 + 0, 0 + 1, 0 + 1, 0 + 0), (0 + 0, 0 + 1, 0 + 0, 0 + 1), (0 + 0, 0 + 0, 0 + 1, 0 + 1)},S3 = {(0 + 1, 0 + 1, 0 + 1, 0 + 0), (0 + 1, 0 + 1, 0 + 0, 0 + 1), (0 + 1, 0 + 0, 0 + 1, 0 + 1), (0 + 0, 0 + 1, 0 + 1, 0 + 1)},S4 = {(1 + 0, 1 + 0, 1 + 0, 1 + 0)}.Let us investigate the question of what species a variant part may have. It can be analyzed independently from a base one, taking into account that a base part can be any. Consider a directed graph with vertices corresponding to variant parts and with edges determined by the existence of at least one base part that let go from one variant part to another. We are interested only in vertices reachable from {(0, 0, 0, 0)}.Proposition. For all the vertices reachable from zero the following properties hold(1) xij ≤ 2,(2) k ≤ 13.Let us prove that all the vertices not having the properties (1) and (2) are unreachable from zero. Consider a variant part with the property (1). To get all edges going from it you have to try all possible base parts. Note that base parts, that consist of the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3 and contain at lest one 0, are enough. Indeed, base part influence which elements are minimal, and 1 will be added to them. A base part can be always normed to contain at least one 0. If a base part contains numbers greater than 3, then the corresponding positions will never be minimal (since 4+0 > 0+2) and they can be changed equivalently by 3 (3+0 > 0+2).Unfortunately, my attempts to deal with cases by hand were unsuccessful, so I wrote the program that traverse the described graph. Starting from 0, it builds edges trying only \"small\" base parts described in the previous paragraph. As a result, the program obtains all the reachable variant parts (there is a little more than 1000 of them) and check (1) and (2) for them. In addition, the program helps to construct a test with k = 13.The problem was supposed to be a problem on intuition. Participants have another solution passed. Their solution generate all permutations and distribute students greedily with respect to each permutation.This solution was a complete surprise for me. Unfortunately, it is wrong. Test 66 against it was added. Of course, submissions accepted during the round won't be rejudged. If such a solution be expected, most likely I wouldn't give such a task. In terms of intuition this solution is not better and not worse than mine. I hope you will not judge me strictly: it is a beautiful problem, and it was interesting to see how it would be solved. Problem EConsider a graph with floors as vertices and staircases as edges. It is clear that Harry can visit the whole connected component in which he is currently located.Every edge can be used to reach a new vertex for not more than two times. If a connected component contains n vertices and m edges, only n - 1 edges are used to reach a new vertex during its traversal. The remaining m - n + 1 edges are not used to reach a new vertex in their initial placement. So they will be used to reach a new vertex not more than once.So using edges of only one connected component you can reach no more than n - m + 1 new vertices. Totally there are not more than   reachable vertices. If m < k - 1, it is impossible to visit all the vertices.  We show that otherwise (m >= k - 1), if the degree of the vertex 0 is different from zero, it is possible to visit all the vertices. In other words, there is such a traversal that every edge can be moved.  Use depth-first search for the current component. If a current edge goes to an already visited vertex, move it to a new component and traverse it recursively. If a current edge goes to a new vertex, after you visit this vertex and go back, you also can move this edge to a new component. As a result each edge can be moved and used again, if you reach all the components. If a component contains at least one edge, you can go from it to the next one. First visit components with edges, and you will visit them all and by the inequality (m >= k - 1) there are enough edges to visit all the isolated vertices.  If the degree of the vertex 1 is zero, you can not start a traversal before you move some edge to it. After that you can go by this edge and remove it with the vertex 1 from the graph, becase you can not use this edge once more. If the chose edge is a bridge, you get k connected components and m - 1 egdes. If it is not a bridge, you get k - 1 components and m - 1 edges. In the first case the inequality m >= k - 1 turns m >= k. In the second case -  m >= k - 1. So if not all the edges are bridges, you should not take a bridge. If they all are bridges, you should disconnect an edge from a vertex of degree >= 2 not to came back to the initial situation with the zero degree of the first vertex. If there is no such vertex, it is easy to check that there is no solution.",

          "content": "Задача AРассмотрим сначала случай, когда все числа отличны от нуля. Тогда можно взять a*c*e граммов песка, получить из них b*c*e граммов свинца, из них - b*d*e граммов золота, из них - b*d*f граммов песка. Если b*d*f > a*c*e, то можно неограниченно увеличивать количество песка, а, соответственно, и золота. В противном случае, когда b*d*f <= a*c*e, сколь угодно большое количество золота получить невозможно. То же самое верно, если у дроби (a*c*e)/(b*d*f) только числитель или только знаменатель равен нулю. В противном случае возникает неопределенность 0/0 и нужно делать отдельную проверку случаев.Поясню, почему я сделала эту задачу именно задачей A. 1. Для решения задачи требуются совсем незначительные знания по программированию (только if), поэтому она была доступна всем участникам.2. Хитрые случаи действительно были, но я понадеялась, что \"сильные участники ... помогут новичкам отловить все баги своими взломами\". Так оно и вышло.Хотя, возможно, я была не права: эта задача слишком сложная для А. Большое количество взломов по этой задаче - вполне предвиденное обстоятельство. Специально оставила большой класс тестов, не вошедший в претесты, чтобы было интереснее ломать. Ради справедливости стоит отметить, что Артем Рахов был против этого. В связи с этой задачей остро всплыла проблема, о которой написал Gassa: претесты отражают весьма неполный набор случаев и заранее непонятно, какой это набор и как интерпретировать событие \"решение прошло претесты\". Мне кажется, стоит обсудить этот вопрос и четко определить принципы разработки претестов.Задача B Задача решается жадно. Заменим одну цифру в первой дате таким образом, чтобы год получился наименьшим возможным. На каждом следующем шаге будем перебирать все замены одной цифры в очередной дате и выбирать такую, которая делает дату не меньше предыдущей и при этом как можно меньшей. Если последний год не превзошел 2011 - решение найдено. Иначе решения не существует.Как это доказать? Рассмотрим некоторое правильное решение. Ясно, что если первая дата в нем не совпадает с наименьшим числом, которое можно получить из первого заданного, то можно заменить ее на это число. Вторую дату также можно заменить на наименьшее возможное число, не превосходящее первого и т.д. В результате мы получим из любого решения тот жадный вариант, который научились строить. А если такого жадного варианта не существует - то и решения не существует.Также можно было решать задачу динамикой.Задача CБудем отдельно для каждого звена ломаной определять, может ли Гарри поймать снитч на нем. Заметим, что так как vp ≥ vs, то если Гарри может поймать снитч в некоторый момент времени, то он сможет поймать его и в более поздний момент времени. Он сможет просто лететь за снитчем по его траектории. Поэтому используем бинарный поиск на каждом отрезке.Отдельно остановлюсь на проблемах с EPS, возникших у участников. Проблемы могли возникнуть из-за того, что1) некоторый EPS стоял в условии: while (leftTime + EPS < rightTime) <делать бинпоиск>. В задаче нужно было с определенной точностью выводить не только время, но и координаты точки. Если время отличается от правильного не больше, чем на EPS, то координаты точки могут отличаться значительно сильнее. В таких случаях нужно сравнивать не аргумент функции, а саму функцию с EPS. Или, как обычно делаю я и что однажды не понравилось преподавателю по численным методам, делать некоторое фиксированное количество итераций бинпоиска (например, 60).2) EPS в сравнении времен внутри бинпоиска вроде этого:if (currentTime + addTime > distance / potterSpeed - EPS)                                                rightTime = currentTime;                                        else                                                leftTime = currentTime;Здесь его вообще лучше убрать. Или поставить EPS значительно меньше по сравнению с точностью, с которой надо выводить точку.(Приведенные фрагменты кода - из решения Егора.)Таким образом, никакого криминала с жесткими ограничениями не было. Возможно, в подобных задачах крайние тесты на точность должны содержаться в претестах? Но это снова о принципах составления претестов.UPD. У задачи существует еще и аналитическое решение. Рассмотрим i-й отрезок. Пусть (xi, yi, zi) и (xi + 1, yi + 1, zi + 1) - его концы, ti - время, за которое снитч достигает его начала. Тогда в момент времени t снитч будет в точке (x, y, z), x = xi + (xi + 1 - xi)(t - ti) / Ti, y = yi + (yi + 1 - yi)(t - ti) / Ti, z = zi + (zi + 1 - zi)(t - ti) / Ti, Ti - время, необходимое снитчу для преодоления всего отрезка. Чтобы поймать снитч в точке (x, y, z), Гарри нужно преодолеть расстояние, квадрат которого (x - Px)2 + (y - Py)2 + (z - Pz)2 за время t. Это возможно, если (x - Px)2 + (y - Py)2 + (z - Pz)2 ≤ (tvp)2. Чтобы найти наименьший подходящий момент t, нужно решить соответствующее квадратное уравнение.Задача DОбозначим через Si множество всевозможных распределений первых i по учеников по факультетам, представляющее собой множество четверок вида (a1, a2, a3, a4), где a1 - количество учеников, отправленных в Гриффиндор, a2 - в Когтевран и т.д. Интуитивно понятно, что эти множества будут небольшими. Поэтому можно, тривиальным образом переходя от Si - 1 к Si, получить Sn, и по нему определить ответ.Как же все-таки строго обосновать такой алгоритм? Пусть имеется некоторое множество S = {(ai1, ai2, ai3, ai4)}i = 1, 2, ..., k. Представим его элементы в виде aij = bj + xij, xij ≥ 0, причем bj выбраны максимально возможными, т.е. для любого j найдется i, такое, что xij = 0. Назовем кортеж (b1, b2, b3, b4) базовой частью для S, а множество {(xi1, xi2, xi3, xi4)}i = 1, 2, ..., k -- вариантной частью. В самом начале для S0 и базовая, и вариантная части равны нулю. Проследим, как изменяются базовая и вариантная часть при рассмотрении очередного ученика. Если для этого ученика факультет фиксирован, но изменится только базовая часть. Она увеличится на 1 в позиции, соответствующей факультету. Из этого, в частности, следует, что можно получить множество с любой базовой частью (поскольку заданная во входном файле строка может содержать любую комбинацию символов G, H, R, S). Если же очередной символ в строке '?', то это может повлиять на изменение и базовой, и вариантной частей.Например, для строки '????' имеем:S0 = {(0 + 0, 0 + 0, 0 + 0, 0 + 0)},S1 = {(0 + 1, 0 + 0, 0 + 0, 0 + 0), (0 + 0, 0 + 1, 0 + 0, 0 + 0), (0 + 0, 0 + 0, 0 + 1, 0 + 0), (0 + 0, 0 + 0, 0 + 0, 0 + 1)},S2 = {(0 + 1, 0 + 1, 0 + 0, 0 + 0), (0 + 1, 0 + 0, 0 + 1, 0 + 0), (0 + 1, 0 + 0, 0 + 0, 0 + 1), (0 + 0, 0 + 1, 0 + 1, 0 + 0), (0 + 0, 0 + 1, 0 + 0, 0 + 1), (0 + 1, 0 + 0, 0 + 1, 0 + 1)},S3 = {(0 + 1, 0 + 1, 0 + 1, 0 + 0), (0 + 1, 0 + 1, 0 + 0, 0 + 1), (0 + 1, 0 + 0, 0 + 1, 0 + 1), (0 + 0, 0 + 1, 0 + 1, 0 + 1)\\},S4 = {(1 + 0, 1 + 0, 1 + 0, 1 + 0)}.Исследуем вопрос о том, какой вид может иметь вариантная часть. Ее можно рассматривать независимо от базовой, учитывая при этом, что базовая может быть любой. Рассмотрим орграф, вершинами которого являются вариантные части, а ребра определяются тем, существует ли хотя бы одна базовая часть, при которой от одной вариантной части можно перейти к другой. Нас интересуют лишь те вершины, которые достижимы из {(0, 0, 0, 0)}.Утверждение. Для всех достижимых из нуля вершин(1) xij ≤ 2,(2) k ≤ 13.Докажем, что все не обладающие свойствами (1) и (2) вершины недостижимы из нуля. Пусть имеется вариантная часть, обладающая свойством (1). Чтобы перебрать переходы из нее, нужно рассмотреть все возможные базовые части. Заметим, что достаточно рассмотреть базовые части, состоящие из чисел 0, 1, 2, 3 и содержащие хотя бы один 0. Действительно, базовая часть влияет на то, какие элементы будут минимальными, и к ним буде прибавление единицы. Базовую часть всегда можно нормировать, чтобы она содержала хотя бы один 0. Если базовая часть содержит числа больше 3, то соответствующие позиции никогда не будут минимальными (т.к. 4+0 > 0+2) и их можно эквивалентным образом заменить на 3 (3+0 > 0+2).К сожалению, мои попытки рассмотрения случаев вручную ни к чему не привели, поэтому я написала программу, которая обходит описанный граф. Начиная из вершины 0, она строит переходы, перебирая лишь \"маленькие\" базовые части, описанные в предыдущем абзаце. В итоге эта программа перебирает все достижимые вариантные части (их оказывается чуть больше 1000) и проверяет, что они удовлетворяют условиям (1) и (2). Кроме того, программа позволяет построить тест с k = 13.Задача вообщем-то предполагалась как задача на интуицию. Некоторые участники сдали другое решение, которое обсуждается здесь. В нем перебираются все перестановки и происходит жадное распределение учеников по факультетам в соответствии с каждой перестановкой. Для меня такое решение оказалось полной неожиданностью. К сожалению, оно неправильное. Добавлен тест 66 против него. Перетестирования решений, сданных  во время раунда, разумеется, не будет. Если бы такое решение предвиделось, скорее всего я не стала бы давать такую задачу. Ведь с точки зрения интуиции оно ничем не лучше и не хуже моего. Надеюсь, меня не будут судить строго: все-таки красивая задача, интересно было посмотреть, как ее порешают.Задача EРассмотрим граф, вершинами которого являются этажи, а ребрами - лестницы. Ясно, что, не двигая лестниц, Гарри сможет посетить всю компоненту связности, в которой находится его текущее местоположение. Каждое ребро может быть использовано для достижения новой вершины не более, чем два раза. Если компонента связности содержит n вершин и m ребер, то при обходе этой компоненты мы используем только n - 1 ребро для достижения новой вершины. Остальные m - n + 1 ребро не будут использованы для достижения новой вершины при их изначальном расположении. Поэтому они будут использованы для достижения новой вершины не более чем по одному разу. Получаем, что используя ребра только одной компоненты связности, можно достичь не более чем n + m - 1 новых вершин. Всего получается не более чем достижимых вершин. Если m < k - 1, то получается, что все вершины посетить невозможно.Покажем, что в противном случае (m >= k - 1) и если степень вершины 1 отлична от нуля, можно обойти все вершины. Иначе говоря, можно будет придумать такой порядок обхода, чтобы можно было переместить каждое из ребер. Будем обходить текущую компоненту обходом в глубину. Если нам встретилось ребро, ведущее в уже посещенную вершину - перенаправим его в новую компоненту и обойдем ее рекурсивно. После того, как мы прошли по ребру в новую вершину и вернулись обратно, тоже перенаправим его в новую компоненту. В итоге каждое ребро получится использовать повторно, если мы дойдем до всех компонент. Если компонента содержит хотя бы одно ребро, из нее можно перейти к следующей. Если в первую очередь перебирать только компоненты с ребрами, мы пройдем по ним по всем и по неравенству (m >= k -1) нам хватит ребер для посещения изолированных вершин.Если степень вершины 1 равна нулю, мы не можем начать обход, пока не перенаправим в нее какое-нибудь ребро. После этого мы пройдем по этому ребру и выкинем его вместе с вершиной 1 из графа, так как больше использовать это ребро не сможем. Если выбранное ребро - мост, то мы получим в итоге k компонент связности и m - 1 ребро. Если не мост - k - 1 компоненту связности и m - 1 ребро. В первом случае условие m >= k - 1 превращается в условие m >= k. Во втором - m >= k - 1. Поэтому если не все ребра мосты, нужно брать не мост. Если все - мосты, нужно отсоединять ребро от вершины степени >= 2, чтобы не прийти в начальную ситуацию с нулевой степенью первой вершины. Если такой вершины не найдется, то легко показать, что нет решения.",

There are only two students before Hermione. The first student is sent to Hufflepuff. The second disciple is given the choice between the houses where the least number of students has been sent, i.e. Gryffindor, Slytherin and Ravenclaw. If he chooses Gryffindor, Hermione is forced to choose between Ravenclaw and Slytherin, if he chooses Ravenclaw, Hermione will choose between Gryffindor and Slytherin, if he chooses Slytherin, Hermione will choose between Gryffindor and Ravenclaw. In the end, the following situation is possible (it depends on the choice of the second student and Hermione). Hermione will end up 1) in Gryffindor, 2) in Ravenclaw, 3) in Slytherin. Note that, despite the fact that in neither case Hermione will be given a choice between all the three options, they are all possible and they should all be printed in the answer.

          "content": "Problem AFist, consider the case when all the numbers are non-zero. You can take a*c*e grams of sand, turn them into b*c*e grams of lead, and them turn into b*d*e grams of gold, and them turn into b*d*f grams of sand. If b*d*f > a*c*e, you can infinitely increase the amount of sand and consequently the amount of gold. Otherwise, if b*d*f <= a*c*e, it is impossible to get infinitely large amount of gold. The same is true when the fraction  (a*c*e)/(b*d*f) has zero numerator only or zero denuminator only. Otherwise there is 0/0, and  you have to check cases specially.I explain, why I make this problem to be problem A.1. Solution of the problem requires very little knowledge of programming (only \"if\"), so it was feasible for all participants.2. Tricky cases really exist, but I hoped that \"stronger competitors will ... help newcomers to catch all bugs by their hacks\". And so it happened.Maybe I was wrong: this problem is too complex for A.A large number of hacks for this problem is a quite foreseen circumstance. I haven't include the special class of tests into the pretests intendently, to make hacking more interesting. In fairness I should note that Artem Rakhov was against this idea. Beause of this task the problem surfaced that Gassa writes about here in Russian: pretests cover some incomplete set of cases and it is not clear in advance what the event \"solution passed pretests\" means. I think it should be discussed, and strong principles of pretests development should be stated.Problem B The problem has greedy solution. Change a digit in the first date to make it as small as possible. At each of the next steps try all one-digit exchanges in the current date and choose one that makes the date not less than the previous one and as small as possible at the same time. If the last year won't exceed 2011 - the answer is found. Otherwise there is no solution.How to prove that? Consider any correct answer. Clearly, if the first date in it is different from the smallest possible number that can be obtained from the first of given years, your can put the smallest number instead of it. The second date can be exchanged by the smallest possible number not exceeding the first number, etc.Ar a result you obtain a greedy solution that is built by the algorithm described above. If the greedy solution doesn't exist, solution doesn't esist too.The problem also has a dynamic solution.Problem CCheck for each segment in the polyline if Harry can catch the snitch in it. Note that since vp ≥ vs, if Harry can catch the snitch at some moment of time, he can catch it at any later moment. He can just follow snitch along its trajectory. So use binary search in each segment.About problems with EPS that participants got. The problems may be caused by1) some EPS in the condition: while (leftTime + EPS < rightTime) <do binary search>. The task was to output with a fixed accurancy not only the time, but also the point coordinates. If the difference between the time and the right one is less than EPS, the difference between coordinates may be significantly larger. In such cases you should compare not arguments of a function, but values of the function with EPS. Or the way that I usually follow and that once was not liked by the teacher of numerical methods - to implement some fixed number of iterations of the binary search (say, 60).  2) EPS in comparison of time moments inside the binary search like this:if (currentTime + addTime > distance / potterSpeed - EPS)                                                rightTime = currentTime;                                        else                                                leftTime = currentTime;Here it is better to remove EPS at all. Or to put EPS significantly smaller than the required accurancy for printing the point.(Code fragments are from Egor's solution.)Thus, there was no crime with severe limitations. Probably for such problems extreme accurancy tests should be in pretests? It is about principles of pretests making again. UPD. The problem has an analytical solution too. Consider the i-th segment. Let (xi, yi, zi) and (xi + 1, yi + 1, zi + 1) be its ends, and let ti be the time required for the snitch to reach the beginning of the segment. Then at the moment t the snitch will be at the point (x, y, z), x = xi + (xi + 1 - xi)(t - ti) / Ti, y = yi + (yi + 1 - yi)(t - ti) / Ti, z = zi + (zi + 1 - zi)(t - ti) / Ti, Ti is a time necessary for snitch to overcome the segment. To catch the snitch at the point (x, y, z), Harry have to overcome the distance that squared is equal to (x - Px)2 + (y - Py)2 + (z - Pz)2 for the time t. It is possible if (x - Px)2 + (y - Py)2 + (z - Pz)2 ≤ (tvp)2. To find the minimal proper moment t, solve the corresponding quadratic equation.Problem DLet Si be a set of all possible assignments of the first i students to the houses, that is a set of tuples (a1, a2, a3, a4), where a1 is a number of students sent to Gryffindor, a2 - to Ravenclaw, etc. It's intuitively clear that these sets will not be large. So you can get Si - 1 from Si in a trivial way, and get finally Sn, and determine the answer from it. What is a rigorous proof of the algorithm? Let us have a set S = {(ai1, ai2, ai3, ai4)}i = 1, 2, ..., k. Represent its elements as aij = bj + xij, xij ≥ 0, where bj are maximal possible, i.e. there is i for each j such that xij = 0. Let the tuple (b1, b2, b3, b4) be called the base part of S, and the set {(xi1, xi2, xi3, xi4)}i = 1, 2, ..., k be called the variant part of S. Initially for S0 both base and variant parts are zeroes. Let us see how base and variant parts change when a current student is added. If a house is fixed for the student, only the base part changes. It increases by 1 at the position corresponding to the house. In particular, it follows that a set with every base part can be obtained (since the string given in the input can contain every combination of symbols G, H, R, S). If the current symbol in the string is '?', it can influence both base and variant parts.For example, for the string '????' we have:S0 = {(0 + 0, 0 + 0, 0 + 0, 0 + 0)},S1 = {(0 + 1, 0 + 0, 0 + 0, 0 + 0), (0 + 0, 0 + 1, 0 + 0, 0 + 0), (0 + 0, 0 + 0, 0 + 1, 0 + 0), (0 + 0, 0 + 0, 0 + 0, 0 + 1)},S2 = {(0 + 1, 0 + 1, 0 + 0, 0 + 0), (0 + 1, 0 + 0, 0 + 1, 0 + 0), (0 + 1, 0 + 0, 0 + 0, 0 + 1), (0 + 0, 0 + 1, 0 + 1, 0 + 0), (0 + 0, 0 + 1, 0 + 0, 0 + 1), (0 + 0, 0 + 0, 0 + 1, 0 + 1)},S3 = {(0 + 1, 0 + 1, 0 + 1, 0 + 0), (0 + 1, 0 + 1, 0 + 0, 0 + 1), (0 + 1, 0 + 0, 0 + 1, 0 + 1), (0 + 0, 0 + 1, 0 + 1, 0 + 1)},S4 = {(1 + 0, 1 + 0, 1 + 0, 1 + 0)}.Let us investigate the question of what species a variant part may have. It can be analyzed independently from a base one, taking into account that a base part can be any. Consider a directed graph with vertices corresponding to variant parts and with edges determined by the existence of at least one base part that let go from one variant part to another. We are interested only in vertices reachable from {(0, 0, 0, 0)}.Proposition. For all the vertices reachable from zero the following properties hold(1) xij ≤ 2,(2) k ≤ 13.Let us prove that all the vertices not having the properties (1) and (2) are unreachable from zero. Consider a variant part with the property (1). To get all edges going from it you have to try all possible base parts. Note that base parts, that consist of the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3 and contain at lest one 0, are enough. Indeed, base part influence which elements are minimal, and 1 will be added to them. A base part can be always normed to contain at least one 0. If a base part contains numbers greater than 3, then the corresponding positions will never be minimal (since 4+0 > 0+2) and they can be changed equivalently by 3 (3+0 > 0+2).Unfortunately, my attempts to deal with cases by hand were unsuccessful, so I wrote the program that traverse the described graph. Starting from 0, it builds edges trying only \"small\" base parts described in the previous paragraph. As a result, the program obtains all the reachable variant parts (there is a little more than 1000 of them) and check (1) and (2) for them. In addition, the program helps to construct a test with k = 13.The problem was supposed to be a problem on intuition. Participants have another solution passed. Their solution generate all permutations and distribute students greedily with respect to each permutation.This solution was a complete surprise for me. Unfortunately, it is wrong. Test 66 against it was added. Of course, submissions accepted during the round won't be rejudged. If such a solution be expected, most likely I wouldn't give such a task. In terms of intuition this solution is not better and not worse than mine. I hope you will not judge me strictly: it is a beautiful problem, and it was interesting to see how it would be solved. Problem EConsider a graph with floors as vertices and staircases as edges. It is clear that Harry can visit the whole connected component in which he is currently located.Every edge can be used to reach a new vertex for not more than two times. If a connected component contains n vertices and m edges, only n - 1 edges are used to reach a new vertex during its traversal. The remaining m - n + 1 edges are not used to reach a new vertex in their initial placement. So they will be used to reach a new vertex not more than once.So using edges of only one connected component you can reach no more than n - m + 1 new vertices. Totally there are not more than   reachable vertices. If m < k - 1, it is impossible to visit all the vertices.  We show that otherwise (m >= k - 1), if the degree of the vertex 0 is different from zero, it is possible to visit all the vertices. In other words, there is such a traversal that every edge can be moved.  Use depth-first search for the current component. If a current edge goes to an already visited vertex, move it to a new component and traverse it recursively. If a current edge goes to a new vertex, after you visit this vertex and go back, you also can move this edge to a new component. As a result each edge can be moved and used again, if you reach all the components. If a component contains at least one edge, you can go from it to the next one. First visit components with edges, and you will visit them all and by the inequality (m >= k - 1) there are enough edges to visit all the isolated vertices.  If the degree of the vertex 1 is zero, you can not start a traversal before you move some edge to it. After that you can go by this edge and remove it with the vertex 1 from the graph, becase you can not use this edge once more. If the chose edge is a bridge, you get k connected components and m - 1 egdes. If it is not a bridge, you get k - 1 components and m - 1 edges. In the first case the inequality m >= k - 1 turns m >= k. In the second case -  m >= k - 1. So if not all the edges are bridges, you should not take a bridge. If they all are bridges, you should disconnect an edge from a vertex of degree >= 2 not to came back to the initial situation with the zero degree of the first vertex. If there is no such vertex, it is easy to check that there is no solution.",

Дальнейший вывод должен иметь вид: перемещения Гарри перемещение лестницы перемещения Гарриперемещение лестницы...перемещение лестницыперемещения ГарриКаждый блок «перемещения Гарри» должен представлять собой список этажей в порядке их посещения. Суммарное число элементов в списках перемещений Гарри не должно превосходить 106. При выводе каждого списка сначала выводится количество элементов в нем, затем в той же строке — сами элементы через пробел. Первым числом в первом списке должен быть номер 1 (этаж, с которого Гарри начинает поиски). Любой список, кроме первого, может содержать нулевое количество элементов. Обратите внимание, что Гарри может посещать некоторые этажи повторно, но обязательно должен посетить все n этажей хотя бы по одному разу. Два последовательно посещаемых этажа должны быть непосредственно соединены лестницей (в момент перехода между ними). Никакие два этажа, посещенные последовательно, не должны совпадать.При описании «перемещения лестницы» указывается номер лестницы (лестницы нумеруются целыми числами от 1 до m в порядке их задания во входных данных) и ее новое положение (два номера соединяемых этажей в произвольном порядке).Одну лестницу можно переместить не более одного раза.

          "content": "Задача AРассмотрим сначала случай, когда все числа отличны от нуля. Тогда можно взять a*c*e граммов песка, получить из них b*c*e граммов свинца, из них - b*d*e граммов золота, из них - b*d*f граммов песка. Если b*d*f > a*c*e, то можно неограниченно увеличивать количество песка, а, соответственно, и золота. В противном случае, когда b*d*f <= a*c*e, сколь угодно большое количество золота получить невозможно. То же самое верно, если у дроби (a*c*e)/(b*d*f) только числитель или только знаменатель равен нулю. В противном случае возникает неопределенность 0/0 и нужно делать отдельную проверку случаев.Поясню, почему я сделала эту задачу именно задачей A. 1. Для решения задачи требуются совсем незначительные знания по программированию (только if), поэтому она была доступна всем участникам.2. Хитрые случаи действительно были, но я понадеялась, что \"сильные участники ... помогут новичкам отловить все баги своими взломами\". Так оно и вышло.Хотя, возможно, я была не права: эта задача слишком сложная для А. Большое количество взломов по этой задаче - вполне предвиденное обстоятельство. Специально оставила большой класс тестов, не вошедший в претесты, чтобы было интереснее ломать. Ради справедливости стоит отметить, что Артем Рахов был против этого. В связи с этой задачей остро всплыла проблема, о которой написал Gassa: претесты отражают весьма неполный набор случаев и заранее непонятно, какой это набор и как интерпретировать событие \"решение прошло претесты\". Мне кажется, стоит обсудить этот вопрос и четко определить принципы разработки претестов.Задача B Задача решается жадно. Заменим одну цифру в первой дате таким образом, чтобы год получился наименьшим возможным. На каждом следующем шаге будем перебирать все замены одной цифры в очередной дате и выбирать такую, которая делает дату не меньше предыдущей и при этом как можно меньшей. Если последний год не превзошел 2011 - решение найдено. Иначе решения не существует.Как это доказать? Рассмотрим некоторое правильное решение. Ясно, что если первая дата в нем не совпадает с наименьшим числом, которое можно получить из первого заданного, то можно заменить ее на это число. Вторую дату также можно заменить на наименьшее возможное число, не превосходящее первого и т.д. В результате мы получим из любого решения тот жадный вариант, который научились строить. А если такого жадного варианта не существует - то и решения не существует.Также можно было решать задачу динамикой.Задача CБудем отдельно для каждого звена ломаной определять, может ли Гарри поймать снитч на нем. Заметим, что так как vp ≥ vs, то если Гарри может поймать снитч в некоторый момент времени, то он сможет поймать его и в более поздний момент времени. Он сможет просто лететь за снитчем по его траектории. Поэтому используем бинарный поиск на каждом отрезке.Отдельно остановлюсь на проблемах с EPS, возникших у участников. Проблемы могли возникнуть из-за того, что1) некоторый EPS стоял в условии: while (leftTime + EPS < rightTime) <делать бинпоиск>. В задаче нужно было с определенной точностью выводить не только время, но и координаты точки. Если время отличается от правильного не больше, чем на EPS, то координаты точки могут отличаться значительно сильнее. В таких случаях нужно сравнивать не аргумент функции, а саму функцию с EPS. Или, как обычно делаю я и что однажды не понравилось преподавателю по численным методам, делать некоторое фиксированное количество итераций бинпоиска (например, 60).2) EPS в сравнении времен внутри бинпоиска вроде этого:if (currentTime + addTime > distance / potterSpeed - EPS)                                                rightTime = currentTime;                                        else                                                leftTime = currentTime;Здесь его вообще лучше убрать. Или поставить EPS значительно меньше по сравнению с точностью, с которой надо выводить точку.(Приведенные фрагменты кода - из решения Егора.)Таким образом, никакого криминала с жесткими ограничениями не было. Возможно, в подобных задачах крайние тесты на точность должны содержаться в претестах? Но это снова о принципах составления претестов.UPD. У задачи существует еще и аналитическое решение. Рассмотрим i-й отрезок. Пусть (xi, yi, zi) и (xi + 1, yi + 1, zi + 1) - его концы, ti - время, за которое снитч достигает его начала. Тогда в момент времени t снитч будет в точке (x, y, z), x = xi + (xi + 1 - xi)(t - ti) / Ti, y = yi + (yi + 1 - yi)(t - ti) / Ti, z = zi + (zi + 1 - zi)(t - ti) / Ti, Ti - время, необходимое снитчу для преодоления всего отрезка. Чтобы поймать снитч в точке (x, y, z), Гарри нужно преодолеть расстояние, квадрат которого (x - Px)2 + (y - Py)2 + (z - Pz)2 за время t. Это возможно, если (x - Px)2 + (y - Py)2 + (z - Pz)2 ≤ (tvp)2. Чтобы найти наименьший подходящий момент t, нужно решить соответствующее квадратное уравнение.Задача DОбозначим через Si множество всевозможных распределений первых i по учеников по факультетам, представляющее собой множество четверок вида (a1, a2, a3, a4), где a1 - количество учеников, отправленных в Гриффиндор, a2 - в Когтевран и т.д. Интуитивно понятно, что эти множества будут небольшими. Поэтому можно, тривиальным образом переходя от Si - 1 к Si, получить Sn, и по нему определить ответ.Как же все-таки строго обосновать такой алгоритм? Пусть имеется некоторое множество S = {(ai1, ai2, ai3, ai4)}i = 1, 2, ..., k. Представим его элементы в виде aij = bj + xij, xij ≥ 0, причем bj выбраны максимально возможными, т.е. для любого j найдется i, такое, что xij = 0. Назовем кортеж (b1, b2, b3, b4) базовой частью для S, а множество {(xi1, xi2, xi3, xi4)}i = 1, 2, ..., k -- вариантной частью. В самом начале для S0 и базовая, и вариантная части равны нулю. Проследим, как изменяются базовая и вариантная часть при рассмотрении очередного ученика. Если для этого ученика факультет фиксирован, но изменится только базовая часть. Она увеличится на 1 в позиции, соответствующей факультету. Из этого, в частности, следует, что можно получить множество с любой базовой частью (поскольку заданная во входном файле строка может содержать любую комбинацию символов G, H, R, S). Если же очередной символ в строке '?', то это может повлиять на изменение и базовой, и вариантной частей.Например, для строки '????' имеем:S0 = {(0 + 0, 0 + 0, 0 + 0, 0 + 0)},S1 = {(0 + 1, 0 + 0, 0 + 0, 0 + 0), (0 + 0, 0 + 1, 0 + 0, 0 + 0), (0 + 0, 0 + 0, 0 + 1, 0 + 0), (0 + 0, 0 + 0, 0 + 0, 0 + 1)},S2 = {(0 + 1, 0 + 1, 0 + 0, 0 + 0), (0 + 1, 0 + 0, 0 + 1, 0 + 0), (0 + 1, 0 + 0, 0 + 0, 0 + 1), (0 + 0, 0 + 1, 0 + 1, 0 + 0), (0 + 0, 0 + 1, 0 + 0, 0 + 1), (0 + 1, 0 + 0, 0 + 1, 0 + 1)},S3 = {(0 + 1, 0 + 1, 0 + 1, 0 + 0), (0 + 1, 0 + 1, 0 + 0, 0 + 1), (0 + 1, 0 + 0, 0 + 1, 0 + 1), (0 + 0, 0 + 1, 0 + 1, 0 + 1)\\},S4 = {(1 + 0, 1 + 0, 1 + 0, 1 + 0)}.Исследуем вопрос о том, какой вид может иметь вариантная часть. Ее можно рассматривать независимо от базовой, учитывая при этом, что базовая может быть любой. Рассмотрим орграф, вершинами которого являются вариантные части, а ребра определяются тем, существует ли хотя бы одна базовая часть, при которой от одной вариантной части можно перейти к другой. Нас интересуют лишь те вершины, которые достижимы из {(0, 0, 0, 0)}.Утверждение. Для всех достижимых из нуля вершин(1) xij ≤ 2,(2) k ≤ 13.Докажем, что все не обладающие свойствами (1) и (2) вершины недостижимы из нуля. Пусть имеется вариантная часть, обладающая свойством (1). Чтобы перебрать переходы из нее, нужно рассмотреть все возможные базовые части. Заметим, что достаточно рассмотреть базовые части, состоящие из чисел 0, 1, 2, 3 и содержащие хотя бы один 0. Действительно, базовая часть влияет на то, какие элементы будут минимальными, и к ним буде прибавление единицы. Базовую часть всегда можно нормировать, чтобы она содержала хотя бы один 0. Если базовая часть содержит числа больше 3, то соответствующие позиции никогда не будут минимальными (т.к. 4+0 > 0+2) и их можно эквивалентным образом заменить на 3 (3+0 > 0+2).К сожалению, мои попытки рассмотрения случаев вручную ни к чему не привели, поэтому я написала программу, которая обходит описанный граф. Начиная из вершины 0, она строит переходы, перебирая лишь \"маленькие\" базовые части, описанные в предыдущем абзаце. В итоге эта программа перебирает все достижимые вариантные части (их оказывается чуть больше 1000) и проверяет, что они удовлетворяют условиям (1) и (2). Кроме того, программа позволяет построить тест с k = 13.Задача вообщем-то предполагалась как задача на интуицию. Некоторые участники сдали другое решение, которое обсуждается здесь. В нем перебираются все перестановки и происходит жадное распределение учеников по факультетам в соответствии с каждой перестановкой. Для меня такое решение оказалось полной неожиданностью. К сожалению, оно неправильное. Добавлен тест 66 против него. Перетестирования решений, сданных  во время раунда, разумеется, не будет. Если бы такое решение предвиделось, скорее всего я не стала бы давать такую задачу. Ведь с точки зрения интуиции оно ничем не лучше и не хуже моего. Надеюсь, меня не будут судить строго: все-таки красивая задача, интересно было посмотреть, как ее порешают.Задача EРассмотрим граф, вершинами которого являются этажи, а ребрами - лестницы. Ясно, что, не двигая лестниц, Гарри сможет посетить всю компоненту связности, в которой находится его текущее местоположение. Каждое ребро может быть использовано для достижения новой вершины не более, чем два раза. Если компонента связности содержит n вершин и m ребер, то при обходе этой компоненты мы используем только n - 1 ребро для достижения новой вершины. Остальные m - n + 1 ребро не будут использованы для достижения новой вершины при их изначальном расположении. Поэтому они будут использованы для достижения новой вершины не более чем по одному разу. Получаем, что используя ребра только одной компоненты связности, можно достичь не более чем n + m - 1 новых вершин. Всего получается не более чем достижимых вершин. Если m < k - 1, то получается, что все вершины посетить невозможно.Покажем, что в противном случае (m >= k - 1) и если степень вершины 1 отлична от нуля, можно обойти все вершины. Иначе говоря, можно будет придумать такой порядок обхода, чтобы можно было переместить каждое из ребер. Будем обходить текущую компоненту обходом в глубину. Если нам встретилось ребро, ведущее в уже посещенную вершину - перенаправим его в новую компоненту и обойдем ее рекурсивно. После того, как мы прошли по ребру в новую вершину и вернулись обратно, тоже перенаправим его в новую компоненту. В итоге каждое ребро получится использовать повторно, если мы дойдем до всех компонент. Если компонента содержит хотя бы одно ребро, из нее можно перейти к следующей. Если в первую очередь перебирать только компоненты с ребрами, мы пройдем по ним по всем и по неравенству (m >= k -1) нам хватит ребер для посещения изолированных вершин.Если степень вершины 1 равна нулю, мы не можем начать обход, пока не перенаправим в нее какое-нибудь ребро. После этого мы пройдем по этому ребру и выкинем его вместе с вершиной 1 из графа, так как больше использовать это ребро не сможем. Если выбранное ребро - мост, то мы получим в итоге k компонент связности и m - 1 ребро. Если не мост - k - 1 компоненту связности и m - 1 ребро. В первом случае условие m >= k - 1 превращается в условие m >= k. Во втором - m >= k - 1. Поэтому если не все ребра мосты, нужно брать не мост. Если все - мосты, нужно отсоединять ребро от вершины степени >= 2, чтобы не прийти в начальную ситуацию с нулевой степенью первой вершины. Если такой вершины не найдется, то легко показать, что нет решения.",

We can just emulate it or get an O(1) formula, because process is very simple.651B - Beautiful PaintingsIdea author: fcspartakm, preparation: fcspartakm.Lets look at the optimal answer. It will contain several segment of increasing beauty and between them there will be drops in the beautifulness. Solution is greedy. Lets sort all paintings and lets select which of them will be in the first increasing segment. We just go from left to right and select only one painting from each group of several paintings with the fixed beauty value. We continue this operation while there is at least one painting left.With the careful implementation we will get solution.But this solution gives us the whole sequence, but the problem was a little bit easier — to determine number of such segments. From the way we construct answer it is easy to see that the number of segments always equal to the maximal number of copies of one value. Obviously we can't get less segments than that and our algorithm gives us exactly this number. This solution is O(n).651C - Watchmen/650A - WatchmenIdea author: ipavlov, preparation: ipavlov.When Manhattan distance equals to Euclidean distance?deu2 = (x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2dmh2 = (|x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|)2 = (x1 - x2)2 + 2|x1 - x2||y1 - y2| + (y1 - y2)2So it is true only when x1 = x2 or y1 = y2. This means that to count the number of such pair we need to calculate number of points on each horizontal line and each vertical line. We can do that easily with the use of std::map/TreeMap/HashMap/Dictionary, or just by sorting all coordinates. If we have k points on one horizontal or vertical line they will add k(k - 1) / 2 pairs to the result. But if we have several points in one place we will count their pairs twice, so we need to subtract from answer number of pairs of identical points which we can calculate with the same formula and using the same method of finding equal values as before.If we use TreeMap/sort then solution will run in and if unordered_map/HashMap then in O(n).651D - Image Preview/650B - Image PreviewIdea author: fcspartakm, preparation: fcspartakm.What photos we will see in the end? Some number from the beginning of the gallery and some from the end. There are 4 cases: We always go right. We always go left. We initially go right, then reverse direction, go through all visited photos and continue going left. We initially go left, then reverse direction, go through all visited photos and continue going right. First two cases are straightforward, we can just emulate them. Third and fourth cases can be done with the method of two pointers. Note that if we see one more picture to the right, we spend more time on the right side and the number of photos seen to the left will decrease.This solution will run in O(n). Alternative solution is to fix how many photos we've seen to the right and search how many we can see to the left with binary search. For this method we will need to precompute times of seeing k pictures to the right and to the left. But this is solution is , which is slightly worse then previous one, but maybe it is easier for somebody.651E - Table Compression/650C - Table CompressionIdea author: LHiC, preparation: iskhakovt.First we will solve our problem when all values are different. We will construct a graph, where vertices are cells (i,  j) and there is an edge between two of them if we know that one is strictly less then the other and this relation should be preserved. This graph obviously has no cycles, so we can calculate answer as dynamic programming on the vertices: for ( (u, v) : Edges) {\n\tdp[v] = max(dp[v], dp[u] + 1);\n}We can do this with topological sort or with lazy computations.But if we will construct our graph naively then it will contain O(nm(n + m)) edges. To reduce this number we will sort each row and column and add edges only between neighbours in the sorted order. Now we have O(nm) edges and we compute them in time.But to solve the problem completely in the beginning we need to compress all equal values which are in the same rows and columns. We can construct second graph with edges between equal cells in the same way as before and find all connected components in it. They will be our new vertices for the first graph.650D - Zip-lineIdea author: LHiC, preparation: LHiC.We need to find the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) after each change if all changes are independent.First lets calculate LIS for the initial array and denote its length as k. While calculating it we will store some additional information: lenl[i] — maximal length of LIS ending on this element. Also we will need lenr[i] — maximal length of LIS starting from this element (we can calc it when searching longest decreasing sequence on reversed array).Lets solve the case when we take our new element in the resulting LIS. Then we just calculate maxi < a, h[i] < b(lenl[i]) + 1 + maxj > a, h[j] > b(lenr[j]). It can be done online with persistent segment tree or offline with scanline with regular segment tree in time. This is the only case when answer can be larger then k, and it can be only k + 1 to be exact. Second case is when we change our element and ruin all LIS of size k. Then answer is k - 1. Otherwise we will have at least one not ruined LIS of size k and it is the answer.Lets calculate number of different LIS by some modulo. It can be done with the same dynamic programming with segment tree as just finding LIS. Then we can check if liscount = liscountleft[a] * liscountright[a]. This exactly means that all sequences go through our element.But if you don't want the solution with such \"hashing\" there is another approach. For each element we can calc if it can be in LIS. If so then we know on which position it will go (lenl[i]). Then for each position we will know if there are several elements wanting to go on that position or only one. If only one then it means that all LIS are going through that element.Overall complexity is .P.S. We can solve this without segment tree, just using alternative approach to calculating LIS with dynamic programming and binary search.650E - Clockwork BombIdea author: Zlobober, preparation: Zlobober.First idea is that answer is always equals to the number of edges from the first tree, which are not in the second one. This means that if we have an edge in both trees we will never touch it. So if we have such edge we can remove this edge and merge its two vertices together, nothing will change.Second idea that if we will take any edge from the first tree there always exists some edge from the second tree, which we can swap (otherwise second graph is not connected, but the tree is always connected). So the order of adding edges from the first tree can be arbitrary. Third idea is that if we will select leaf node in the first tree, then cut its only edge, then we can add instead of it any edge going from this vertex in the second tree.Overall algorithm: we store linked lists of edges in vertices, when edge is in both trees we use disjoint-set union to merge vertices and join their lists. We can simply traverse first tree to get any order of edges in which the current edge will always contain leaf as one of its vertices.Complexity is O(nα), which in practice is almost linear.",

Раунд составлен из задач первого тура X Открытой олимпиады школьников по программированию, который состоится завтра же в это время, а также нескольких задач, подготовленных специально для раунда. Раунд был подготовлен силами научного комитета московских олимпиад по программированию под руководством GlebsHP, romanandreev и вашего покорного слуги, а также fcspartakm, который помог нам дополнить комплект задач до полноценного раунда.Соревнование пройдёт по обычным правилам Codeforces, вам будут предложены 5 задач на два часа. Да, раунд рейтинговый :)Обращаем ваше внимание, что из-за проведения основного тура системное тестирование и дорешивание будет отложено до 15:35. Также просим воздержаться от обсуждения задач в комментариях в период между концом тура и окончанием основного тура олимпиады. Все комментарии с обсуждением задач будут тереться, а особенно настырные нарушители будут наказываться. Благодарим за понимание.UPD Приносим прощения, начало раунда было сдвинуто на 12:25 по Москве. Нелёгкое это дело — проводить онсайт-соревнование и раунд на Codeforces!UPD2 Можно обсуждать решения! Системное тестирование будет запущено в ближайшее время.UPD3 Наконец-то появился разбор: http://codeforces.com/blog/entry/43677 Приносим свои извинения за задержку с публикацией!",

          "content": "651A - ДжойстикиАвтор идеи: fcspartakm, разработчик: fcspartakm.Главной идеей решения является то, что в каждый момент времени нам нужно заряжать джойстик с самым низким уровнем заряда. По-этому мы можем просто проэмулировать процесс или вывести простую формулу за O(1).651B - Красота картинАвтор идеи: fcspartakm, разработчик: fcspartakm.Давайте посмотрим на ответ, в нем будет несколько подряд идущих отрезков возрастания красоты, а между ними красота будет падать. Будем решать задачу жадно: давайте отсортируем массив значений и будем набирать возрастающие куски по очереди. Чтобы набрать очередной кусок мы идем слева-направо и среди каждого множества картин с одинаковым значением мы выберем только одно. Так будем продолжать пока картины не закончатся.Если аккуратно это реализовать, то получим решение за .Но такое решение дает нам всю последовательность, но в задаче от нас по-сути просили вычислить только число отрезков возрастания. Из прошлого решения следует, что мы наберем столько отрезков возрастания, сколько максимум раз повторяется в массиве одно из наших чисел. Очевидно, что мы не можем набрать меньше. Получаем решение за O(n).651C - Хранители/650A - ХранителиАвтор идеи: ipavlov, разработчик: ipavlov.Когда манхетенское расстояние совпадает с евклидовым?deu2 = (x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2dmh2 = (|x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|)2 = (x1 - x2)2 + 2|x1 - x2||y1 - y2| + (y1 - y2)2Это означает, что они равны только когда x1 = x2 или y1 = y2. Что посчитать ответ нам нужно выяснить, сколько точек лежат на каждой горизонтальной и на каждой вертикальной прямой. Это легко сделать с помощью std::map/TreeMap/HashMap/Dictionary, или если просто отсортировать координаты. Если у нас есть k точек на одной горизонтальной или вертикальной прямой, то они добавят в ответ k(k - 1) / 2 пар. Но таким образом мы дважды посчитаем пары совпадающих точек, то есть нужно будет вычесть из ответа посчитанные таким же способом числа пар одинаковых точек.Если мы воспользовались TreeMap/sort, то мы получим решение за , а если unordered_map/HashMap, то O(n).651D - Просмотр фотографий/650B - Просмотр фотографийАвтор идеи: fcspartakm, разработчик: fcspartakm.Какие фотографии мы увидим в конце? Сколько-то от начала и возможно сколько-то с конца. Всего есть 4 случая: Мы всегда двигались только вправо. Мы всегда двигались только налево. Сначала мы двигались направо, потом сменили направление движения, прошли все просмотренные фото и продолжили движение налево. Сначала мы двигались налево, потом сменили направление движения, прошли все просмотренные фото и продолжили движение направо. Первые два случая делаются банально, просто эмулируем. Третий и четвертый случай можно решить с помощью метода двух указателей. Заметим, что если мы пройдем в третем случае на одну картину больше справа, то мы потратим больше времени и число просмотренных фото слева уменьшится. Так двигаем эти два указателя и пересчитываем текущее время.Это решение работает за O(n). Альтернативным решением является зафиксировать сколько мы пройдем справа, а потом найти сколько мы пройдем слева с помощью бинарного поиска. Для этого нам нужно будет предподсчитать для каждой позиции слева и справа, сколько времени мы потратим, дойдя до нее.Это работает за , что немного дольше, но возможно кому-то так проще было решать.651E - Сжатие таблицы/650C - Сжатие таблицыАвтор идеи: LHiC, разработчик: iskhakovt.Сначала решим задачу, когда все значения различны. Мы построим граф, где вершинами будут являться ячейки таблицы, а ребра будут вести из одной ячейки в другую, если у первой значение меньше, чем у второй и они лежат в одной строке или в одном столбце. В этом графе нет циклов, так что мы можем вычислить сжатые номера ответа с помощью динамического программирования: for ( (u, v) : Edges) {\n\tdp[v] = max(dp[v], dp[u] + 1);\n}Мы можем это сделать с помощью топологической сортировки или ленивых вычислений.Если мы построим граф как описано, то в нем будет O(nm(n + m)) ребер. Чтобы уменьшить это число мы отсортируем каждую строку и каждый столбец и добавим ребра только между соседями в этом порядке. Тепеть у нас O(nm) ребер, которые мы вычисляем за время .Теперь вспомним про одинаковые значения. Давайте построим точно так же второй граф, но теперь в нем ребра будут означать равенство. Теперь если мы найдем компоненты связности в этом графе, они и будут являться вершинами нашего нового первого графа.650D - Канатная дорогаАвтор идеи: LHiC, разработчик: LHiC.Нам нужно вычислять длину наибольшей возрастающей подпоследовательности (НВП) после каждого из независимых изменений к массиву.Для начала вычислим длину НВП в нашем исходном массиве и обозначим её за k. Пока мы это вычисляем, нам понадобится хранить дополнительную информацию lenl[i] — максимальную длину НВП, заканчивающуюся на данном элементе. Аналогично нам понадобится lenr[i] — максимальная длина НВП, начинающейся с данного элемента (мы можем это вычислить аналогично, только нужно будет идти по массиву в обратную сторону).Давайте решим тот случай, когда наш новый элемент будет лежать в новой НВП. Длина максимальной НВП, проходящей через эту точку будет равна maxi < a, h[i] < b(lenl[i]) + 1 + maxj > a, h[j] > b(lenr[j]). Это можно вычислить онлайн с помощью персистентного дерева отрезков или оффлайн с помощью обычного дерева отрезков и метода сканирующей прямой, что будет работать за на запрос. Это единственный случай, когда ответ будет больше k, точнее он может быть только k + 1.Во втором случае, когда наш элемент не входит в ответ, но то что мы его поменяли привело к порче всех исходных НВП, то ответ будет k - 1. Иначе у нас останется хотя бы одна НВП длины k, она и будет ответом.Как это понять? Давайте посчитаем число НВП в исходном массиве по какому-нибудь модулю. Мы можем это сделать с помощью динамического программирования также, как мы искали саму НВП, например с помощью дерева отрезков. Тогда мы можем проверить, если liscount = liscountleft[a] * liscountright[a], то это как раз означает, что все НВП проходят через наш элемент.Если вам не нравится решение с таким \"хешированием\", то есть алтернативный честный подход. Для каждого элемента давайте поймем, может ли он входить в какую-нибудь исходную НВП, а если может, то на какой позиции(эта позиция будет как раз равна lenl[i]). Тогда для каждой позиции мы посчитаем, сколько различных элементов претендуют на нее. Если только один элемент, то это как раз и означает, что все НВП проходят через него.Получаем решение за .P.S. Мы можем решить эту задачу без использования структур данных с помощью альтернативного метода вычисления НВП с помощью динамического программирования и бинарного поиска.650E - Часовой механизмАвтор идеи: Zlobober, разработчик: Zlobober.Первое соображение: ответ всегда равен числу ребер, которые есть в первом дереве, но которых нет во втором. Это означает, что если у нас есть ребро, которое лежит в обоих деревьях, то это ребро можно удалить, а те две вершины, которые оно соединяло, объединить в одну, ничего не изменится.Второе соображение: если мы возьмем любое ребро из первого дерева и удалим его, то всегда найдется корректное ребро из второго дерева, которое можно вставить обратно (если такого нету, то это означает, что второй граф не связен, а он дерево, противоречие). Таким образом порядок замены ребер из первого дерева может быть произвольный.Третье соображение: если мы взяли лист в первом дереве, выкинули соответствующее ему ребро, то мы можем добавить любое ребро из второго дерева, которое ведет из данной вершины.В итоге получаем алгоритм: храним списки ребер в вершинах, когда ребро общее, то объединяем вершины с помощью системы непересекающихся множеств, а их списки склеиваем вместе. Чтобы получить порядок ребер в первом дереве мы сделаем его обход в глубину и получим такой список, что если мы уже убрали все прошлые ребра, то следующее всегда будет листом.Получаем асимптотику O(nα), что на практике является линейным алгоритмом.",

This round is brought to you by the scientific committee of Moscow Programming Olympiads controlled by GlebsHP, romanandreev and your humble servant, and also with a great help of fcspartakm who helped us make a complete problemset of our problems.The round will be conducted under the standard Codeforces rules, you will be given 5 problems for 2 hours. Yes, this round is rated :)Note that because of holding the main onsite round system testing and upsolving will be available no earlier than 12:35 UTC. Also we would like to ask you to not discuss problems in comments during the time between the end of the round and the end of the onsite competition. All comments with discussions will be removed and the most active violators will be punished. Thanks for your understanding.UPD Sorry, the round start was moved to 9:25 UTC. It is not easy to run onsite round and Codeforces Round simultaneously!UPD2 You may discuss the solutions! System testing will be run shortly.UPD3 The editorial has finally appeared: http://codeforces.com/blog/entry/43677 Sorry for the delay!",

          "content": "651A - JoysticksIdea author: fcspartakm, preparation: fcspartakm.Main idea is that each second we need to charge the joystick with lowest power level. We can just emulate it or get an O(1) formula, because process is very simple.651B - Beautiful PaintingsIdea author: fcspartakm, preparation: fcspartakm.Lets look at the optimal answer. It will contain several segment of increasing beauty and between them there will be drops in the beautifulness. Solution is greedy. Lets sort all paintings and lets select which of them will be in the first increasing segment. We just go from left to right and select only one painting from each group of several paintings with the fixed beauty value. We continue this operation while there is at least one painting left.With the careful implementation we will get solution.But this solution gives us the whole sequence, but the problem was a little bit easier — to determine number of such segments. From the way we construct answer it is easy to see that the number of segments always equal to the maximal number of copies of one value. Obviously we can't get less segments than that and our algorithm gives us exactly this number. This solution is O(n).651C - Watchmen/650A - WatchmenIdea author: ipavlov, preparation: ipavlov.When Manhattan distance equals to Euclidean distance?deu2 = (x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2dmh2 = (|x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|)2 = (x1 - x2)2 + 2|x1 - x2||y1 - y2| + (y1 - y2)2So it is true only when x1 = x2 or y1 = y2. This means that to count the number of such pair we need to calculate number of points on each horizontal line and each vertical line. We can do that easily with the use of std::map/TreeMap/HashMap/Dictionary, or just by sorting all coordinates. If we have k points on one horizontal or vertical line they will add k(k - 1) / 2 pairs to the result. But if we have several points in one place we will count their pairs twice, so we need to subtract from answer number of pairs of identical points which we can calculate with the same formula and using the same method of finding equal values as before.If we use TreeMap/sort then solution will run in and if unordered_map/HashMap then in O(n).651D - Image Preview/650B - Image PreviewIdea author: fcspartakm, preparation: fcspartakm.What photos we will see in the end? Some number from the beginning of the gallery and some from the end. There are 4 cases: We always go right. We always go left. We initially go right, then reverse direction, go through all visited photos and continue going left. We initially go left, then reverse direction, go through all visited photos and continue going right. First two cases are straightforward, we can just emulate them. Third and fourth cases can be done with the method of two pointers. Note that if we see one more picture to the right, we spend more time on the right side and the number of photos seen to the left will decrease.This solution will run in O(n). Alternative solution is to fix how many photos we've seen to the right and search how many we can see to the left with binary search. For this method we will need to precompute times of seeing k pictures to the right and to the left. But this is solution is , which is slightly worse then previous one, but maybe it is easier for somebody.651E - Table Compression/650C - Table CompressionIdea author: LHiC, preparation: iskhakovt.First we will solve our problem when all values are different. We will construct a graph, where vertices are cells (i,  j) and there is an edge between two of them if we know that one is strictly less then the other and this relation should be preserved. This graph obviously has no cycles, so we can calculate answer as dynamic programming on the vertices: for ( (u, v) : Edges) {\n\tdp[v] = max(dp[v], dp[u] + 1);\n}We can do this with topological sort or with lazy computations.But if we will construct our graph naively then it will contain O(nm(n + m)) edges. To reduce this number we will sort each row and column and add edges only between neighbours in the sorted order. Now we have O(nm) edges and we compute them in time.But to solve the problem completely in the beginning we need to compress all equal values which are in the same rows and columns. We can construct second graph with edges between equal cells in the same way as before and find all connected components in it. They will be our new vertices for the first graph.650D - Zip-lineIdea author: LHiC, preparation: LHiC.We need to find the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) after each change if all changes are independent.First lets calculate LIS for the initial array and denote its length as k. While calculating it we will store some additional information: lenl[i] — maximal length of LIS ending on this element. Also we will need lenr[i] — maximal length of LIS starting from this element (we can calc it when searching longest decreasing sequence on reversed array).Lets solve the case when we take our new element in the resulting LIS. Then we just calculate maxi < a, h[i] < b(lenl[i]) + 1 + maxj > a, h[j] > b(lenr[j]). It can be done online with persistent segment tree or offline with scanline with regular segment tree in time. This is the only case when answer can be larger then k, and it can be only k + 1 to be exact. Second case is when we change our element and ruin all LIS of size k. Then answer is k - 1. Otherwise we will have at least one not ruined LIS of size k and it is the answer.Lets calculate number of different LIS by some modulo. It can be done with the same dynamic programming with segment tree as just finding LIS. Then we can check if liscount = liscountleft[a] * liscountright[a]. This exactly means that all sequences go through our element.But if you don't want the solution with such \"hashing\" there is another approach. For each element we can calc if it can be in LIS. If so then we know on which position it will go (lenl[i]). Then for each position we will know if there are several elements wanting to go on that position or only one. If only one then it means that all LIS are going through that element.Overall complexity is .P.S. We can solve this without segment tree, just using alternative approach to calculating LIS with dynamic programming and binary search.650E - Clockwork BombIdea author: Zlobober, preparation: Zlobober.First idea is that answer is always equals to the number of edges from the first tree, which are not in the second one. This means that if we have an edge in both trees we will never touch it. So if we have such edge we can remove this edge and merge its two vertices together, nothing will change.Second idea that if we will take any edge from the first tree there always exists some edge from the second tree, which we can swap (otherwise second graph is not connected, but the tree is always connected). So the order of adding edges from the first tree can be arbitrary. Third idea is that if we will select leaf node in the first tree, then cut its only edge, then we can add instead of it any edge going from this vertex in the second tree.Overall algorithm: we store linked lists of edges in vertices, when edge is in both trees we use disjoint-set union to merge vertices and join their lists. We can simply traverse first tree to get any order of edges in which the current edge will always contain leaf as one of its vertices.Complexity is O(nα), which in practice is almost linear.",

This round is brought to you by the scientific committee of Moscow Programming Olympiads controlled by GlebsHP, romanandreev and your humble servant, and also with a great help of fcspartakm who helped us make a complete problemset of our problems.The round will be conducted under the standard Codeforces rules, you will be given 5 problems for 2 hours. Yes, this round is rated :)Note that because of holding the main onsite round system testing and upsolving will be available no earlier than 12:35 UTC. Also we would like to ask you to not discuss problems in comments during the time between the end of the round and the end of the onsite competition. All comments with discussions will be removed and the most active violators will be punished. Thanks for your understanding.UPD Sorry, the round start was moved to 9:25 UTC. It is not easy to run onsite round and Codeforces Round simultaneously!UPD2 You may discuss the solutions! System testing will be run shortly.UPD3 The editorial has finally appeared: http://codeforces.com/blog/entry/43677 Sorry for the delay!",

          "content": "651A - JoysticksIdea author: fcspartakm, preparation: fcspartakm.Main idea is that each second we need to charge the joystick with lowest power level. We can just emulate it or get an O(1) formula, because process is very simple.651B - Beautiful PaintingsIdea author: fcspartakm, preparation: fcspartakm.Lets look at the optimal answer. It will contain several segment of increasing beauty and between them there will be drops in the beautifulness. Solution is greedy. Lets sort all paintings and lets select which of them will be in the first increasing segment. We just go from left to right and select only one painting from each group of several paintings with the fixed beauty value. We continue this operation while there is at least one painting left.With the careful implementation we will get solution.But this solution gives us the whole sequence, but the problem was a little bit easier — to determine number of such segments. From the way we construct answer it is easy to see that the number of segments always equal to the maximal number of copies of one value. Obviously we can't get less segments than that and our algorithm gives us exactly this number. This solution is O(n).651C - Watchmen/650A - WatchmenIdea author: ipavlov, preparation: ipavlov.When Manhattan distance equals to Euclidean distance?deu2 = (x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2dmh2 = (|x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|)2 = (x1 - x2)2 + 2|x1 - x2||y1 - y2| + (y1 - y2)2So it is true only when x1 = x2 or y1 = y2. This means that to count the number of such pair we need to calculate number of points on each horizontal line and each vertical line. We can do that easily with the use of std::map/TreeMap/HashMap/Dictionary, or just by sorting all coordinates. If we have k points on one horizontal or vertical line they will add k(k - 1) / 2 pairs to the result. But if we have several points in one place we will count their pairs twice, so we need to subtract from answer number of pairs of identical points which we can calculate with the same formula and using the same method of finding equal values as before.If we use TreeMap/sort then solution will run in and if unordered_map/HashMap then in O(n).651D - Image Preview/650B - Image PreviewIdea author: fcspartakm, preparation: fcspartakm.What photos we will see in the end? Some number from the beginning of the gallery and some from the end. There are 4 cases: We always go right. We always go left. We initially go right, then reverse direction, go through all visited photos and continue going left. We initially go left, then reverse direction, go through all visited photos and continue going right. First two cases are straightforward, we can just emulate them. Third and fourth cases can be done with the method of two pointers. Note that if we see one more picture to the right, we spend more time on the right side and the number of photos seen to the left will decrease.This solution will run in O(n). Alternative solution is to fix how many photos we've seen to the right and search how many we can see to the left with binary search. For this method we will need to precompute times of seeing k pictures to the right and to the left. But this is solution is , which is slightly worse then previous one, but maybe it is easier for somebody.651E - Table Compression/650C - Table CompressionIdea author: LHiC, preparation: iskhakovt.First we will solve our problem when all values are different. We will construct a graph, where vertices are cells (i,  j) and there is an edge between two of them if we know that one is strictly less then the other and this relation should be preserved. This graph obviously has no cycles, so we can calculate answer as dynamic programming on the vertices: for ( (u, v) : Edges) {\n\tdp[v] = max(dp[v], dp[u] + 1);\n}We can do this with topological sort or with lazy computations.But if we will construct our graph naively then it will contain O(nm(n + m)) edges. To reduce this number we will sort each row and column and add edges only between neighbours in the sorted order. Now we have O(nm) edges and we compute them in time.But to solve the problem completely in the beginning we need to compress all equal values which are in the same rows and columns. We can construct second graph with edges between equal cells in the same way as before and find all connected components in it. They will be our new vertices for the first graph.650D - Zip-lineIdea author: LHiC, preparation: LHiC.We need to find the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) after each change if all changes are independent.First lets calculate LIS for the initial array and denote its length as k. While calculating it we will store some additional information: lenl[i] — maximal length of LIS ending on this element. Also we will need lenr[i] — maximal length of LIS starting from this element (we can calc it when searching longest decreasing sequence on reversed array).Lets solve the case when we take our new element in the resulting LIS. Then we just calculate maxi < a, h[i] < b(lenl[i]) + 1 + maxj > a, h[j] > b(lenr[j]). It can be done online with persistent segment tree or offline with scanline with regular segment tree in time. This is the only case when answer can be larger then k, and it can be only k + 1 to be exact. Second case is when we change our element and ruin all LIS of size k. Then answer is k - 1. Otherwise we will have at least one not ruined LIS of size k and it is the answer.Lets calculate number of different LIS by some modulo. It can be done with the same dynamic programming with segment tree as just finding LIS. Then we can check if liscount = liscountleft[a] * liscountright[a]. This exactly means that all sequences go through our element.But if you don't want the solution with such \"hashing\" there is another approach. For each element we can calc if it can be in LIS. If so then we know on which position it will go (lenl[i]). Then for each position we will know if there are several elements wanting to go on that position or only one. If only one then it means that all LIS are going through that element.Overall complexity is .P.S. We can solve this without segment tree, just using alternative approach to calculating LIS with dynamic programming and binary search.650E - Clockwork BombIdea author: Zlobober, preparation: Zlobober.First idea is that answer is always equals to the number of edges from the first tree, which are not in the second one. This means that if we have an edge in both trees we will never touch it. So if we have such edge we can remove this edge and merge its two vertices together, nothing will change.Second idea that if we will take any edge from the first tree there always exists some edge from the second tree, which we can swap (otherwise second graph is not connected, but the tree is always connected). So the order of adding edges from the first tree can be arbitrary. Third idea is that if we will select leaf node in the first tree, then cut its only edge, then we can add instead of it any edge going from this vertex in the second tree.Overall algorithm: we store linked lists of edges in vertices, when edge is in both trees we use disjoint-set union to merge vertices and join their lists. We can simply traverse first tree to get any order of edges in which the current edge will always contain leaf as one of its vertices.Complexity is O(nα), which in practice is almost linear.",

Раунд составлен из задач первого тура X Открытой олимпиады школьников по программированию, который состоится завтра же в это время, а также нескольких задач, подготовленных специально для раунда. Раунд был подготовлен силами научного комитета московских олимпиад по программированию под руководством GlebsHP, romanandreev и вашего покорного слуги, а также fcspartakm, который помог нам дополнить комплект задач до полноценного раунда.Соревнование пройдёт по обычным правилам Codeforces, вам будут предложены 5 задач на два часа. Да, раунд рейтинговый :)Обращаем ваше внимание, что из-за проведения основного тура системное тестирование и дорешивание будет отложено до 15:35. Также просим воздержаться от обсуждения задач в комментариях в период между концом тура и окончанием основного тура олимпиады. Все комментарии с обсуждением задач будут тереться, а особенно настырные нарушители будут наказываться. Благодарим за понимание.UPD Приносим прощения, начало раунда было сдвинуто на 12:25 по Москве. Нелёгкое это дело — проводить онсайт-соревнование и раунд на Codeforces!UPD2 Можно обсуждать решения! Системное тестирование будет запущено в ближайшее время.UPD3 Наконец-то появился разбор: http://codeforces.com/blog/entry/43677 Приносим свои извинения за задержку с публикацией!",

          "content": "651A - ДжойстикиАвтор идеи: fcspartakm, разработчик: fcspartakm.Главной идеей решения является то, что в каждый момент времени нам нужно заряжать джойстик с самым низким уровнем заряда. По-этому мы можем просто проэмулировать процесс или вывести простую формулу за O(1).651B - Красота картинАвтор идеи: fcspartakm, разработчик: fcspartakm.Давайте посмотрим на ответ, в нем будет несколько подряд идущих отрезков возрастания красоты, а между ними красота будет падать. Будем решать задачу жадно: давайте отсортируем массив значений и будем набирать возрастающие куски по очереди. Чтобы набрать очередной кусок мы идем слева-направо и среди каждого множества картин с одинаковым значением мы выберем только одно. Так будем продолжать пока картины не закончатся.Если аккуратно это реализовать, то получим решение за .Но такое решение дает нам всю последовательность, но в задаче от нас по-сути просили вычислить только число отрезков возрастания. Из прошлого решения следует, что мы наберем столько отрезков возрастания, сколько максимум раз повторяется в массиве одно из наших чисел. Очевидно, что мы не можем набрать меньше. Получаем решение за O(n).651C - Хранители/650A - ХранителиАвтор идеи: ipavlov, разработчик: ipavlov.Когда манхетенское расстояние совпадает с евклидовым?deu2 = (x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2dmh2 = (|x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|)2 = (x1 - x2)2 + 2|x1 - x2||y1 - y2| + (y1 - y2)2Это означает, что они равны только когда x1 = x2 или y1 = y2. Что посчитать ответ нам нужно выяснить, сколько точек лежат на каждой горизонтальной и на каждой вертикальной прямой. Это легко сделать с помощью std::map/TreeMap/HashMap/Dictionary, или если просто отсортировать координаты. Если у нас есть k точек на одной горизонтальной или вертикальной прямой, то они добавят в ответ k(k - 1) / 2 пар. Но таким образом мы дважды посчитаем пары совпадающих точек, то есть нужно будет вычесть из ответа посчитанные таким же способом числа пар одинаковых точек.Если мы воспользовались TreeMap/sort, то мы получим решение за , а если unordered_map/HashMap, то O(n).651D - Просмотр фотографий/650B - Просмотр фотографийАвтор идеи: fcspartakm, разработчик: fcspartakm.Какие фотографии мы увидим в конце? Сколько-то от начала и возможно сколько-то с конца. Всего есть 4 случая: Мы всегда двигались только вправо. Мы всегда двигались только налево. Сначала мы двигались направо, потом сменили направление движения, прошли все просмотренные фото и продолжили движение налево. Сначала мы двигались налево, потом сменили направление движения, прошли все просмотренные фото и продолжили движение направо. Первые два случая делаются банально, просто эмулируем. Третий и четвертый случай можно решить с помощью метода двух указателей. Заметим, что если мы пройдем в третем случае на одну картину больше справа, то мы потратим больше времени и число просмотренных фото слева уменьшится. Так двигаем эти два указателя и пересчитываем текущее время.Это решение работает за O(n). Альтернативным решением является зафиксировать сколько мы пройдем справа, а потом найти сколько мы пройдем слева с помощью бинарного поиска. Для этого нам нужно будет предподсчитать для каждой позиции слева и справа, сколько времени мы потратим, дойдя до нее.Это работает за , что немного дольше, но возможно кому-то так проще было решать.651E - Сжатие таблицы/650C - Сжатие таблицыАвтор идеи: LHiC, разработчик: iskhakovt.Сначала решим задачу, когда все значения различны. Мы построим граф, где вершинами будут являться ячейки таблицы, а ребра будут вести из одной ячейки в другую, если у первой значение меньше, чем у второй и они лежат в одной строке или в одном столбце. В этом графе нет циклов, так что мы можем вычислить сжатые номера ответа с помощью динамического программирования: for ( (u, v) : Edges) {\n\tdp[v] = max(dp[v], dp[u] + 1);\n}Мы можем это сделать с помощью топологической сортировки или ленивых вычислений.Если мы построим граф как описано, то в нем будет O(nm(n + m)) ребер. Чтобы уменьшить это число мы отсортируем каждую строку и каждый столбец и добавим ребра только между соседями в этом порядке. Тепеть у нас O(nm) ребер, которые мы вычисляем за время .Теперь вспомним про одинаковые значения. Давайте построим точно так же второй граф, но теперь в нем ребра будут означать равенство. Теперь если мы найдем компоненты связности в этом графе, они и будут являться вершинами нашего нового первого графа.650D - Канатная дорогаАвтор идеи: LHiC, разработчик: LHiC.Нам нужно вычислять длину наибольшей возрастающей подпоследовательности (НВП) после каждого из независимых изменений к массиву.Для начала вычислим длину НВП в нашем исходном массиве и обозначим её за k. Пока мы это вычисляем, нам понадобится хранить дополнительную информацию lenl[i] — максимальную длину НВП, заканчивающуюся на данном элементе. Аналогично нам понадобится lenr[i] — максимальная длина НВП, начинающейся с данного элемента (мы можем это вычислить аналогично, только нужно будет идти по массиву в обратную сторону).Давайте решим тот случай, когда наш новый элемент будет лежать в новой НВП. Длина максимальной НВП, проходящей через эту точку будет равна maxi < a, h[i] < b(lenl[i]) + 1 + maxj > a, h[j] > b(lenr[j]). Это можно вычислить онлайн с помощью персистентного дерева отрезков или оффлайн с помощью обычного дерева отрезков и метода сканирующей прямой, что будет работать за на запрос. Это единственный случай, когда ответ будет больше k, точнее он может быть только k + 1.Во втором случае, когда наш элемент не входит в ответ, но то что мы его поменяли привело к порче всех исходных НВП, то ответ будет k - 1. Иначе у нас останется хотя бы одна НВП длины k, она и будет ответом.Как это понять? Давайте посчитаем число НВП в исходном массиве по какому-нибудь модулю. Мы можем это сделать с помощью динамического программирования также, как мы искали саму НВП, например с помощью дерева отрезков. Тогда мы можем проверить, если liscount = liscountleft[a] * liscountright[a], то это как раз означает, что все НВП проходят через наш элемент.Если вам не нравится решение с таким \"хешированием\", то есть алтернативный честный подход. Для каждого элемента давайте поймем, может ли он входить в какую-нибудь исходную НВП, а если может, то на какой позиции(эта позиция будет как раз равна lenl[i]). Тогда для каждой позиции мы посчитаем, сколько различных элементов претендуют на нее. Если только один элемент, то это как раз и означает, что все НВП проходят через него.Получаем решение за .P.S. Мы можем решить эту задачу без использования структур данных с помощью альтернативного метода вычисления НВП с помощью динамического программирования и бинарного поиска.650E - Часовой механизмАвтор идеи: Zlobober, разработчик: Zlobober.Первое соображение: ответ всегда равен числу ребер, которые есть в первом дереве, но которых нет во втором. Это означает, что если у нас есть ребро, которое лежит в обоих деревьях, то это ребро можно удалить, а те две вершины, которые оно соединяло, объединить в одну, ничего не изменится.Второе соображение: если мы возьмем любое ребро из первого дерева и удалим его, то всегда найдется корректное ребро из второго дерева, которое можно вставить обратно (если такого нету, то это означает, что второй граф не связен, а он дерево, противоречие). Таким образом порядок замены ребер из первого дерева может быть произвольный.Третье соображение: если мы взяли лист в первом дереве, выкинули соответствующее ему ребро, то мы можем добавить любое ребро из второго дерева, которое ведет из данной вершины.В итоге получаем алгоритм: храним списки ребер в вершинах, когда ребро общее, то объединяем вершины с помощью системы непересекающихся множеств, а их списки склеиваем вместе. Чтобы получить порядок ребер в первом дереве мы сделаем его обход в глубину и получим такой список, что если мы уже убрали все прошлые ребра, то следующее всегда будет листом.Получаем асимптотику O(nα), что на практике является линейным алгоритмом.",

The long delay is caused by the high frequency of contests and championships on Codeforces. You can read about educational rounds here and here.<The same as before>The round will be unrated for all users and it will be held with extented ACM ICPC rules. You will have two hours to solve six problems. After that you will have one day to hack any solution you want. You will have access to copy any solution and test it locally.If you have ideas for some problems or maybe already prepared problems that you can't use in rounds or official competitions, you can write to me.It seems that it is harder to invent interesting simple problems (like A and B) than difficult ones. So don't be afraid to suggest interesting simple or very simple tasks.</The same as before>From now traditionally the problemset was totally suggested by Codeforces users. The problem А for the third time was suggested by user unprost (no hope for the short problem statement :-)). The problem B was suggested by user Smaug. The problem C is another problem from the set sent by Bayram Berdiyev bayram, Allanur Shiriyev Allanur and Bekmyrat Atayev Bekmyrat.A. Alexey Dergunov dalex suggested the problems D and E. The problem F was suggested by Lewin Gan Lewin.Thanks a lot to them and all others who are sending the problems or just ideas of the problems!The problems D and E was prepared by Alexey Dergunov dalex. Other problems was prepared by me (Edvard Davtyan). I want to note the generator for the problem E its difficulty comparable with the solution to the problem F. Thanks to Maria Belova Delinur for checking the English statements. The problems was tested by users: unprost, Smaug, Aleksa Plavsic allllekssssa, Alexey Dergunov dalex and Lewin Gan Lewin. Thanks a lot to all of them!I hope you will enjoy the problems!P.S.: I really like the problem F and hope to see Accepted-s for it.Good luck and have fun!UPD: The contest is finished.

The first condition is false and a ≤ b — in this case the caterpillar will never get the apple, because it can't do that on the first day and after each night it will be lower than one day before. If the first two conditions are false easy to see that the answer equals to .

It's easy to do in linear time. Consider some foe pair (a, b) (we may assume posa < posb). Let's store for each value a the leftmost position posb such that (a, b) is a foe pair. Denote that value as za. Now let's iterate over the array a from right to left and maintain the position rg of the maximal correct interval with the left end in the current position lf. To maintain the value rg we should simply take the minimum with the value z[lf]: rg = min(rg, z[lf]). And finally we should increment the answer by the value rg - lf + 1.

In the same way a lot of other problems can be solved (for example the of finding the maximal weighted chain of points so that both coordinates of each point are greater than the coordinates of the predecessing point). Rewrite the problem formally: for each i we should count the number of indices j so that the following conditions are hold: ai < aj and bj < aj. Let's sort all segments by the left ends from right to left and maintain some data structure (Fenwick tree will be the best choice) with the right ends of the processed segments. To calculate the answer for the current segment we should simple take the prefix sum for the right end of the current segment.So the condition ai < aj is hold by sorting and iterating over the segments from the right to the left (the first dimension of the problem). The condition bj < aj is hold by taking the prefix sum in data structure (the second dimension).

Consider the graph with biconnected components as vertices. Easy to see that it's a tree (if it contains some cycle then the whole cycle is a biconnected component). All edges are destroying when we passing over them so we can't returnto the same vertex (in the tree) after leaving it by some edge.Consider the biconncted components that contains the vertices a and b. Let's denote them A and B. Statement: the answer is YES if and only if on the path in the tree from the vertex A to the vertex B there are an edge with an artifact or there are a biconnected component that contains some edge with an artifact. Easy to see that the statement is true: if there are such edge then we can pass over it in the tree on the path from A to B or we can pass over it in biconnected component. The converse also easy to check.Here is one of the ways to find edge biconnected components: Let's orient all edges to direction that depth first search passed it for the first time. Let's find in new directed graph strongly connected components. Statement: the strongly connected components in the new graph coincide with the biconnected components in old undirected graph.Also you can notice that the edges in tree is the bridges of the graph (bridges in terms of graph theory). So you can simply find the edges in the graph.

So we can easily determine the final positions of all the ants, but we can't say which ant will be in which position.The second observation: the relative order of the ants will be the same all the time.So to solve the problem we should only find the position of one ant after t seconds.Let's solve that problem in the following way: Consider the positions of all the ants after m time units. Easy to see that by the first observation all the positions of the ants will left the same, but the order will be different (we will have some cyclic shift of the ants). If we find that cyclic shift sh we can apply it times. After that we will have only t ± od m time units. So the problem now is to model the process for the one ant with m and r ± od m time units. Note that in that time interval the fixed ant will have no more than two collisions with each other ant. So if we model the process with ignoring all collisions except the ones that include the fixed ant, we will have no more than 2n collisions.Let's model that process with two queues for the ants going to the left and to the right. Each time we should take the first ant in the queue with opposite direction, process the collision and add that ant to the end of the other queue.Hint: you will have a problem when the fixed ant can be in two different positions at the end, but it's easy to fix with doing the same with the next ant.

The long delay is caused by the high frequency of contests and championships on Codeforces. You can read about educational rounds here and here.<The same as before>The round will be unrated for all users and it will be held with extented ACM ICPC rules. You will have two hours to solve six problems. After that you will have one day to hack any solution you want. You will have access to copy any solution and test it locally.If you have ideas for some problems or maybe already prepared problems that you can't use in rounds or official competitions, you can write to me.It seems that it is harder to invent interesting simple problems (like A and B) than difficult ones. So don't be afraid to suggest interesting simple or very simple tasks.</The same as before>From now traditionally the problemset was totally suggested by Codeforces users. The problem А for the third time was suggested by user unprost (no hope for the short problem statement :-)). The problem B was suggested by user Smaug. The problem C is another problem from the set sent by Bayram Berdiyev bayram, Allanur Shiriyev Allanur and Bekmyrat Atayev Bekmyrat.A. Alexey Dergunov dalex suggested the problems D and E. The problem F was suggested by Lewin Gan Lewin.Thanks a lot to them and all others who are sending the problems or just ideas of the problems!The problems D and E was prepared by Alexey Dergunov dalex. Other problems was prepared by me (Edvard Davtyan). I want to note the generator for the problem E its difficulty comparable with the solution to the problem F. Thanks to Maria Belova Delinur for checking the English statements. The problems was tested by users: unprost, Smaug, Aleksa Plavsic allllekssssa, Alexey Dergunov dalex and Lewin Gan Lewin. Thanks a lot to all of them!I hope you will enjoy the problems!P.S.: I really like the problem F and hope to see Accepted-s for it.Good luck and have fun!UPD: The contest is finished.

          "content": "652A - Gabriel and CaterpillarThe problem was suggested by unprost.Let's consider three cases. h1 + 8a ≥ h2 — in this case the caterpillar will get the apple on the same day, so the answer is 0. The first condition is false and a ≤ b — in this case the caterpillar will never get the apple, because it can't do that on the first day and after each night it will be lower than one day before. If the first two conditions are false easy to see that the answer equals to . C++ solutionint h1, h2;\nint a, b;\n\nbool read() {\n\treturn !!(cin >> h1 >> h2 >> a >> b);\n}\n\nvoid solve() {\n\tif (h1 + 8 * a >= h2)\n\t\tputs(\"0\");\n\telse if (a > b) {\n\t\tint num = h2 - h1 - 8 * a, den = 12 * (a - b);\n\t\tcout << (num + den - 1) / den << endl;\n\t} else\n\t\tputs(\"-1\");\n}Also this problem can be solved by simple modelling, because the heights and speeds are small.Complexity: O(1).652B - z-sortThe problem was suggested by Smaug.Easy to see that we can z-sort any array a. Let be the number of even positions in a. We can assign to those positions k maximal elements and distribute other n - k elements to odd positions. Obviously the resulting array is z-sorted. C++ solutionconst int N = 1010;\n\nint n, a[N];\n\nbool read() {\n\tif (!(cin >> n)) return false;\n\tforn(i, n) assert(scanf(\"%d\", &a[i]) == 1);\n\treturn true;\n}\n\nint ans[N];\n\nvoid solve() {\n\tsort(a, a + n);\n\n\tint p = 0, q = n - 1;\n\tforn(i, n)\n\t\tif (i & 1) ans[i] = a[q--];\n\t\telse ans[i] = a[p++];\n\tassert(q + 1 == p);\n\n\tforn(i, n) {\n\t\tif (i) putchar(' ');\n\t\tprintf(\"%d\", ans[i]);\n\t}\n\tputs(\"\");\n}Complexity: O(nlogn).652C - Foe PairsThis is one of the problems suggested by Bayram Berdiyev bayram, Allanur Shiriyev Allanur, Bekmyrat Atayev Bekmyrat.A.Let's precompute for each value x its position in permutation posx. It's easy to do in linear time. Consider some foe pair (a, b) (we may assume posa < posb). Let's store for each value a the leftmost position posb such that (a, b) is a foe pair. Denote that value as za. Now let's iterate over the array a from right to left and maintain the position rg of the maximal correct interval with the left end in the current position lf. To maintain the value rg we should simply take the minimum with the value z[lf]: rg = min(rg, z[lf]). And finally we should increment the answer by the value rg - lf + 1. C++ solutionconst int N = 300300;\n\nint n, m;\nint p[N];\npt b[N];\n\nbool read() {\n\tif (!(cin >> n >> m)) return false;\n\tforn(i, n) {\n\t\tassert(scanf(\"%d\", &p[i]) == 1);\n\t\tp[i]--;\n\t}\n\tforn(i, m) {\n\t\tint x, y;\n\t\tassert(scanf(\"%d%d\", &x, &y) == 2);\n\t\tx--, y--;\n\t\tb[i] = pt(x, y);\n\t}\n\treturn true;\n}\n\nint pos[N];\nvector<int> z[N];\n\nvoid solve() {\n\tforn(i, n) pos[p[i]] = i;\n\tforn(i, n) z[i].clear();\n\tforn(i, m) {\n\t\tint x = pos[b[i].x], y = pos[b[i].y];\n\t\tif (x > y) swap(x, y);\n\t\tz[x].pb(y);\n\t}\n\n\tli ans = 0;\n\tint rg = n;\n\tnfor(i, n) {\n\t\tforn(j, sz(z[i])) rg = min(rg, z[i][j]);\n\t\tans += rg - i;\n\t}\n\tcout << ans << endl;\n}Complexity: O(n + m).652D - Nested SegmentsThe problem was suggested by Alexey Dergunov dalex.This problem is a standard two-dimensional problem that can be solved with one-dimensional data structure. In the same way a lot of other problems can be solved (for example the of finding the maximal weighted chain of points so that both coordinates of each point are greater than the coordinates of the predecessing point). Rewrite the problem formally: for each i we should count the number of indices j so that the following conditions are hold: ai < aj and bj < aj. Let's sort all segments by the left ends from right to left and maintain some data structure (Fenwick tree will be the best choice) with the right ends of the processed segments. To calculate the answer for the current segment we should simple take the prefix sum for the right end of the current segment.So the condition ai < aj is hold by sorting and iterating over the segments from the right to the left (the first dimension of the problem). The condition bj < aj is hold by taking the prefix sum in data structure (the second dimension).

Consider the graph with biconnected components as vertices. Easy to see that it's a tree (if it contains some cycle then the whole cycle is a biconnected component). All edges are destroying when we passing over them so we can't returnto the same vertex (in the tree) after leaving it by some edge.Consider the biconncted components that contains the vertices a and b. Let's denote them A and B. Statement: the answer is YES if and only if on the path in the tree from the vertex A to the vertex B there are an edge with an artifact or there are a biconnected component that contains some edge with an artifact. Easy to see that the statement is true: if there are such edge then we can pass over it in the tree on the path from A to B or we can pass over it in biconnected component. The converse also easy to check.Here is one of the ways to find edge biconnected components: Let's orient all edges to direction that depth first search passed it for the first time. Let's find in new directed graph strongly connected components. Statement: the strongly connected components in the new graph coincide with the biconnected components in old undirected graph.Also you can notice that the edges in tree is the bridges of the graph (bridges in terms of graph theory). So you can simply find the edges in the graph.

So we can easily determine the final positions of all the ants, but we can't say which ant will be in which position.The second observation: the relative order of the ants will be the same all the time.So to solve the problem we should only find the position of one ant after t seconds.Let's solve that problem in the following way: Consider the positions of all the ants after m time units. Easy to see that by the first observation all the positions of the ants will left the same, but the order will be different (we will have some cyclic shift of the ants). If we find that cyclic shift sh we can apply it times. After that we will have only t ± od m time units. So the problem now is to model the process for the one ant with m and r ± od m time units. Note that in that time interval the fixed ant will have no more than two collisions with each other ant. So if we model the process with ignoring all collisions except the ones that include the fixed ant, we will have no more than 2n collisions.Let's model that process with two queues for the ants going to the left and to the right. Each time we should take the first ant in the queue with opposite direction, process the collision and add that ant to the end of the other queue.Hint: you will have a problem when the fixed ant can be in two different positions at the end, but it's easy to fix with doing the same with the next ant.

The long delay is caused by the high frequency of contests and championships on Codeforces. You can read about educational rounds here and here.<The same as before>The round will be unrated for all users and it will be held with extented ACM ICPC rules. You will have two hours to solve six problems. After that you will have one day to hack any solution you want. You will have access to copy any solution and test it locally.If you have ideas for some problems or maybe already prepared problems that you can't use in rounds or official competitions, you can write to me.It seems that it is harder to invent interesting simple problems (like A and B) than difficult ones. So don't be afraid to suggest interesting simple or very simple tasks.</The same as before>From now traditionally the problemset was totally suggested by Codeforces users. The problem А for the third time was suggested by user unprost (no hope for the short problem statement :-)). The problem B was suggested by user Smaug. The problem C is another problem from the set sent by Bayram Berdiyev bayram, Allanur Shiriyev Allanur and Bekmyrat Atayev Bekmyrat.A. Alexey Dergunov dalex suggested the problems D and E. The problem F was suggested by Lewin Gan Lewin.Thanks a lot to them and all others who are sending the problems or just ideas of the problems!The problems D and E was prepared by Alexey Dergunov dalex. Other problems was prepared by me (Edvard Davtyan). I want to note the generator for the problem E its difficulty comparable with the solution to the problem F. Thanks to Maria Belova Delinur for checking the English statements. The problems was tested by users: unprost, Smaug, Aleksa Plavsic allllekssssa, Alexey Dergunov dalex and Lewin Gan Lewin. Thanks a lot to all of them!I hope you will enjoy the problems!P.S.: I really like the problem F and hope to see Accepted-s for it.Good luck and have fun!UPD: The contest is finished.

Let be the number of even positions in a. We can assign to those positions k maximal elements and distribute other n - k elements to odd positions. Obviously the resulting array is z-sorted.

It's easy to do in linear time. Consider some foe pair (a, b) (we may assume posa < posb). Let's store for each value a the leftmost position posb such that (a, b) is a foe pair. Denote that value as za. Now let's iterate over the array a from right to left and maintain the position rg of the maximal correct interval with the left end in the current position lf. To maintain the value rg we should simply take the minimum with the value z[lf]: rg = min(rg, z[lf]). And finally we should increment the answer by the value rg - lf + 1.

In the same way a lot of other problems can be solved (for example the of finding the maximal weighted chain of points so that both coordinates of each point are greater than the coordinates of the predecessing point). Rewrite the problem formally: for each i we should count the number of indices j so that the following conditions are hold: ai < aj and bj < aj. Let's sort all segments by the left ends from right to left and maintain some data structure (Fenwick tree will be the best choice) with the right ends of the processed segments. To calculate the answer for the current segment we should simple take the prefix sum for the right end of the current segment.So the condition ai < aj is hold by sorting and iterating over the segments from the right to the left (the first dimension of the problem). The condition bj < aj is hold by taking the prefix sum in data structure (the second dimension).

Consider the graph with biconnected components as vertices. Easy to see that it's a tree (if it contains some cycle then the whole cycle is a biconnected component). All edges are destroying when we passing over them so we can't returnto the same vertex (in the tree) after leaving it by some edge.Consider the biconncted components that contains the vertices a and b. Let's denote them A and B. Statement: the answer is YES if and only if on the path in the tree from the vertex A to the vertex B there are an edge with an artifact or there are a biconnected component that contains some edge with an artifact. Easy to see that the statement is true: if there are such edge then we can pass over it in the tree on the path from A to B or we can pass over it in biconnected component. The converse also easy to check.Here is one of the ways to find edge biconnected components: Let's orient all edges to direction that depth first search passed it for the first time. Let's find in new directed graph strongly connected components. Statement: the strongly connected components in the new graph coincide with the biconnected components in old undirected graph.Also you can notice that the edges in tree is the bridges of the graph (bridges in terms of graph theory). So you can simply find the edges in the graph.

So we can easily determine the final positions of all the ants, but we can't say which ant will be in which position.The second observation: the relative order of the ants will be the same all the time.So to solve the problem we should only find the position of one ant after t seconds.Let's solve that problem in the following way: Consider the positions of all the ants after m time units. Easy to see that by the first observation all the positions of the ants will left the same, but the order will be different (we will have some cyclic shift of the ants). If we find that cyclic shift sh we can apply it times. After that we will have only t ± od m time units. So the problem now is to model the process for the one ant with m and r ± od m time units. Note that in that time interval the fixed ant will have no more than two collisions with each other ant. So if we model the process with ignoring all collisions except the ones that include the fixed ant, we will have no more than 2n collisions.Let's model that process with two queues for the ants going to the left and to the right. Each time we should take the first ant in the queue with opposite direction, process the collision and add that ant to the end of the other queue.Hint: you will have a problem when the fixed ant can be in two different positions at the end, but it's easy to fix with doing the same with the next ant.
